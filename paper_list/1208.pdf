<blockquote>
The BriefBook is a condensed handbook, or an extended glossary, written
in encyclopedic format, covering subjects in 
statistics, computing, analysis, and related fields. It intends 
to be both introduction and reference for data analysts, 
scientists and engineers.

You will access version 16, which is also
available as a book (order directly from
<a href="http://www.springer.de/customers/index.html"> Springer</a> or 
from your preferred bookstore).
The Internet version will be updated occasionally, and is not necessarily
identical to the printed version.
<p>In all cases, we appreciate your feedback:
please send comments, error corrections, or your suggestions for new 
contributions, to
<a href="mailto:rkb@mail.cern.ch">R.K.Bock.</a>

Part of the information has been derived, with permission, from a booklet 
<em>FORMULAE AND METHODS IN EXPERIMENTAL DATA 
EVALUATION</em>, published in 1984 by the European Physical 
Society, and out of print since many years.  
This BriefBook is a major update and extension, but
some original contributions by
V.Blobel (Hamburg), S.Brandt (Siegen), 
R.Fr&#252;hwirth (Vienna), F.James (Geneva), 
J.Myrheim (Copenhagen), and M.Regler (Vienna) are acknowledged.
Parts related to physics have been eliminated 
and are now presented separately as 
<a href="http://rkb.home.cern.ch/rkb/titleD.html">
The Particle Detector BriefBook</a>.

<h2>
Some comments on this Internet version of The Data Analysis BriefBook:</h2>
<p>
The html version has been generated automatically, using
Latex2html version 3.1. Minor adjustments by hand were necessary; if in some
places the html presentation is not optimal, we ask for your understanding.
<p>
Although itself available on Internet with multiple <i>internal</i>
cross references, you will find practically 
no URLs of other <i>external</i> sites; 
we have found much interesting 
information with our browsers, but a good deal of it can be 
characterized as shortlived, unfinished and abandoned,
unchecked, or sometimes even containing outright errors.
<p>
It is our intention to avoid these pitfalls as best we can: the 
BriefBook has been conceived primarily as a book, i.e. with 
stability in mind. The BriefBook is sure to contain some errors: 
we will be eager to correct them.  In some areas, it is incomplete: 
we will include obvious omissions and let it evolve slowly 
towards other, related subjects. Updates, however, will be 
carefully grouped, and somewhat oriented along the lines 
successive printed editions take.
<p>
All this being said, we want to give here some pointers towards 
sites where definitely useful, in many cases more detailed, and hopefully 
long-lived information can be found:
