# correlationModel

It is a toolbox created for the word fixing model (https://github.com/FalsitaFine/wordfixing).

The correlation tool computes the relationship between different terms with the following idea: if two words are likely to appear together in a same text sentence, then they are related.

There are also tools for collecting medical articles and tools for generate training files in this repo.


These tools has not been used in the fixing model, where Word2Vec approach is used instead.



Check corr.csv to see the output.
