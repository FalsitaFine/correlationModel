# correlationModel

It is a tool created for the word fixing model (https://github.com/FalsitaFine/wordfixing).

Compute the relationship between different terms with the following idea: if two words are likely to appear together in a same text sentence, then they are related.

This tool has not been used in the fixing model, where Word2Vec approach is used instead.



Check corr.csv to see the output.
