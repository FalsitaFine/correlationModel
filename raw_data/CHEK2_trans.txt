Yes..Chek2 & BRCA germ line AAAAAions to keep in mind with breast, thyroid and CRC in the family.. 
For AAAes like APC or BRCA, the term "risk variant" or "risk allele" may work. For a gene like CHEK2 where I157T has been shown to have somewhat AAAer AAAAAAance than 1100delC, would the deAAA of difference AAAAAAAAate a different term? 
I think it‚Äôs a major proAAA & inconsistency in terms of how different laA deA with these. Even the well known AAes in CHEK2, APC - laA have different reAAAAAA standards, re AAAAAAAAAAtion AAAAAAry & even wrt AAAAAer or not they are reAAAAA in all instances. AAed AAAAAAAAes

Make sure your AAAAtic counselor AAAes you a clear risk #. Ask for AAAAAAte risk. For example, they may say a 20% increase AAAAAtive risk) which might be from 10% to 12% AAAAAAAte risk). My study of Chek2 is limited, but I do believe it hast to be AAAAAAated with AAAAly history.
