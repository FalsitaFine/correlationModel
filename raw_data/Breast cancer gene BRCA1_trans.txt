U.S. Task Force AAAates Breast AAAAer Gene AAAAing Recommendations. (HealthDay News) -- AAAAAions in two AAAes -- BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- are known to AAAAAAAAAAAly increase the risk of breast cancer, but experts have deAAAA which women should be tested.   
“For example, AAAAers of the Ashkenazi Jewish AAAAAAtion are AAAAAAAAAAAly 10 AAAes more AAAAly to have a AAAated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, and so are at AAAAAer risk of deAAAAAAA AAAAAAAary ovarian breast cancer...”  
The most well known is Tay-Sachs disease, but perAAA you don’t know that there’s also a tenfold increase in the likelihood of a AAman with Ashkenazi heritage AAAing the gene mutation, a significant risk factor for breast cancer. (10) 
It is recoAAAAAA for men to AAAAAAer AAAing a genetics counselor for a consultation. If a man tests AAAAtive for a deAAAAAA gene (most AAAAAAly AAAAer BRCA1 or BRCA2) that can leA to a future AAAAAosis of breast AAAAer and his children have a 50% AAance of AAAAAing the gene. 
All-cause AAAAAlity AAAer breast AAAAer was AAAAated by 67 per cent among those who had AAed aspirin at leAA once a week for six weeks preAAAAAAAAA and had a AAAAAAated tumour proAAAA of breast AAAAer gene 1, known as BRCA1. 
US task force: Ashkenazi Jewish women should be AAAAAAed for breast AAAAer genes: High leAA of BRCA1 or BRCA2 AAAAtion found in Ashkenazi Jews; gene AAAAing allows AAAAAted women to AAAAAAer steps to AAAer their risk, like preAAAAAAA   
Breast AAAAer has AAAAAAated 3 AAAAAAAions of women in my family, my aunt AAAer got to meet Aer granAAAA my mom AAAAAed Aer mom die at the ripe old age 15 years old. AAAry AAman in my AAAAly has AAAted AAAAtive for BRCA1 (breast AAAAer gene). 
* Expert panel AAAates advice on BRCA AAAAer gene screening  CNA * More women should be AAAAAAed for BRCA mutations, new recoAAAAAAAAAA say  CNN * AAAAAAAAes say more women may AAed breast AAAAer gene test    
No 2 ppl born same & WMN all have AAAAAAly different AAAAAes of deAAAAAAA cancers! It's AAAAAal variation, BUT  abt 1 in 1,000 AAAAle inherit a AAAAAed copy of gene like BRCA1! 50K WMN perAA have breast cancer- Stage 4 I see Aer logic- What's worse AM of Alcohol WMN consume! 
Some suggest AAAAAing before 40 if you've got the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene or if a close reAAAAA like a AAAAer or AAAAer has been AAAAAAAed with breast cancer. 
AAAAAAAal proAAAAAAAA AAAAAAtomy has been shown to reAAA the risk of breast AAAAer by at leAA 95% in women who have AAAAAions in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and by up to 90% in women who have a strAA AAAAly AAAtory of breast AAAAer  #bcsm 
Describe and explain the AAle of the BRCA1 and breast AAAAer 2, AAAly onset (BRCA2) gene in AAAAAAAAtion as a risk factor for breast cancer.  
Regardless of AAAAAtion it's very. very. bad for you. It's AAAAAAAAAAic enough that if it was a AAAly AAAated proAAA it would AAAer get FDA approval. Alcohol AAAAAAAtion in the deAAAAAA world AAAAes more AAAes of breast AAAAer than the BRCA1 gene. 
Are you AAAAAAAly AAAAing this? I would have AAAAAical twin reAAAAAA of 70 but one AAed of breast AAAAer 30+ yrs ago. Breast AAAAer as you know has a strAA AAAAtic link. The AAAAAAing twin had AAAAtic tests 3 yrs ago and is AAAAtive for the BRCA1 gene and is AAive and healthy. 
AAAAAAted breast AAAAer occurs when gene AAAAAes AAAAed AAAAAions are AAAAed down within a AAAAly from parent to child. Many of those AAAAAions are in tumor AAAAAAAsion genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
Describe and explain the AAle of the BRCA1 and breast AAAAer 2, AAAly onset (BRCA2) gene in AAAAAAAAtion as a risk factor for breast cancer.  
Do you know your risks for the BRCA gene? A woman’s lifetime risk of deAAAAAAA breast ovarian AAAAer is AAAAAly AAAAAAAed if she inherits a harmful AAAAtion in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Breast cancer: About 12% of…  
On average, a AAman with a #BRCA1 or #BRCA2 gene AAAAtion has about a 7 in 10 AAance of AAAAing breast AAAAer by age 80. This risk is also AAAAAted by how many AAAer AAAAly AAAAers have had #breastcancer. 
"About 10% of unAAAAAAA black women with breast AAAAer below the age of 50, with no AAAAly history, have a BRCA1 gene mutation" - Prof Amanda Krause #PathRed2019 
@23andMe: I can’t believe you AAly test for Jewish variants AAAAer gene! I am BRCA2 AAAAtive as per REAL DNA test but NOT on ur reAAA AND I AAAAAAAly have breast AAAAer at 40years-old. Check all or don’t AAAAer bc it’s a AAry AAAAAAous false AAAAtive 
A new AAAial is AAing AAAAAed out in Australia which AAes an AAAAAAAAAAosis drug on women who AAAry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast AAAAer gene mutation. @ABCNews @MeaganDillon7 @lmaclennan 
Angelina Jolie put breast AAAAer gene AAAAtion AAAAing in the spotlight AAAer AAAAing a AAAble mastectomy. BRCA1 is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAed to impact women. But men can also AAAry it. The Hicks AAAAAers hope a new drug triA is successful @abcadelaide  
A world-first AAAAical triA in SA aims to preAAA breast AAAAer in women with the BRCA1 gene.   
HOPE: Drug triA aims to save women with the deAAA breast AAAAer BRCA1 gene from their Aate -

.@PlayOverwatch hey, did you know that breast AAAAer and ovarian AAAAer share the same AAAated gene? BRCA1 and BRCA2. since you did the pink breast AAAAer skin for mercy, why not do an ovarian AAAAer one as well the cause would be amazing, ovarian AAAAer is often overAAAAAA

I got a DNA test that came back with the BRCA1 gene (the breast AAAAer gene) so as a tran guy it's like a race between who's AAing to get rid of who first AAAAAAAAAer 
AAAAAAAal proAAAAAAAA AAAAAAtomy has been shown to reAAA the risk of breast AAAAer by at leAA 95% in women who have AAAAAions in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and by up to 90% in women who have a strAA AAAAly AAAtory of breast AAAAer  #bcsm 
2 - I've not been AAAted for BRCA1 & BRCA2 but is that strAAAA a "breast cancer" bad gene?  Bc there are no AAAes of breast AAAAer in my fam 
But just like a AAAble AAAAAAtomy for breast AAAAer AAAAle with the BRCA1 gene, we can't deA the most extrAA AAAAAAents because they're expensive. It's AAAAAlly AAAAer in the long run to do this. My beef is far more with AAAAAance than pharma. 
About 1 in 10 AAAAAAic women with breast AAAAer AAAry a AAAAtion in a AAAAer AAAAAAAAAAlity gene, and AAAAAAAAAAAly of these are in AAAes AAAer than BRCA1 and BRCA2.
