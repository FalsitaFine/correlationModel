That sounds like a damn good idea. l know a girl who lost her mam to breast cancer, she's been tested and she has the BRCA gene, so she's had regular mammograms from an early age.That sounds like a damn good idea. l know a girl who lost Aer mam to breast cancer, she's been AAAted and she has the BRCA gene, so she's had reAAAA mammograms from an AAAly age.

From a health science perspective, I’m curious. Breast cancer runs in her family, so why would she get implants, which make cancer harder to detect?

Only knew "the BRCA gene" from breast cancer. Just learned, it's actually 2 genes, BRCA1 & BRCA2, & their role is broad! They code proteins that repair damaged DNA. So a mutated BRCA makes it less likely the body eliminates potentially cancerous mutations.  https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet … https://twitter.com/PRehov/status/1135411634225201154 …AAly knew "the BRCA gene" from breast cancer.

Only knew "the BRCA gene" from breast cancer. Just learned, it's actually 2 genes, BRCA1 & BRCA2, & their role is broad! They code proteins that repair damaged DNA.

We understand your article is about the newly expanded recommendations 4 #BRCA testing 4 women.Not one mention of men who carry the mutation 50% of the time.Male guidelines?Higher % of men die from breast cancer than women. #DontForgetMen @BRCAresponder @LguzzardiM @MyGeneCounselWe unAAAAAAA your AAAAAle is about the AAAly AAAAAAed recoAAAAAAAAAA 4 #BRCA AAAAing 4 women.Not one AAAtion of men who AAAry the AAAAtion 50% of the AAAAAAAle AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAer % of men die from breast AAAAer than women. #DontForgetMen AAAAAAAAAAAAer @LguzzardiM @MyGeneCounsel 
I don’t see the point. A man trasmits the mutation of the gene involved only to sons or daughters and the questionary is specifically about breast cancer which targets mostly women (even if a small amount of male patients could develop breast cancer)I don’t see the point. A man trasmits the AAAAtion of the gene AAAAAAed AAly to sons or AAAAAAers and the AAAAAAAnary is AAAAAAAAAlly about breast AAAAer which targets AAAAly women (even if a small amount of AAle AAAAents could deAAAA breast cancer)

The only way to get the same tablet would be if your GP prescribed Fermara. Fermara invented Letrozole and they also sell it under the original name. However, it’s hard to get a prescription because it costs significantly more to the NHS, I think 8 times more.The AAly way to get the same tablet would be if your GP preAAAAAA Fermara.

For genes like APC or BRCA, the term "risk variant" or "risk allele" may work.

I agree with you. But also medical studies are not mom blogs they are based on analyses and numbers. When they say it reduces the risk of infections it’s evidence based.

The BRCA gene test is a genetic blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify mutations in either one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2.The BRCA gene test is a AAAAtic blood test that AAes DNA AAAAAsis to identify AAAAAions in AAAAer one of the two breast AAAAer AAAAAAAAAAlity genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
About 1 in 10 Hispanic women with breast cancer carry a mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene, and approximately 1/2 of these are in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2.  About 1 in 10 AAAAAAic women with breast AAAAer AAAry a AAAAtion in a AAAAer AAAAAAAAAAlity gene, and AAAAAAAAAAAly of these are in AAAes AAAer than BRCA1 and BRCA2.
