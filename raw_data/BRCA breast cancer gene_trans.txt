 #Men with certain AAAAAAAted #BRCA #gene AAAAAAions also face an AAAAAAAed risk of #breast #cancer. BRCA AAAAAions may increase the risk of AAAer AAAes of AAAAer in women and men as well

It can cause it if you have the BRCA 1 gene for breast cancer. Which is why AAAAle with a AAAtory of breast AAAAer should be AAAted for it BEFORE they get cancer. 
They can also PREVENT AAAAer for anyone with the BRCA 2 gene for breast cancer. The AAAer periAA someone with that gene has, the leA AAAAly they are to deAAAAA ovarian cancer. The BRCA 1 gene is more AAAAAAous with birth control and is what you are mentioning.
