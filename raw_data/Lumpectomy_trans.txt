I‚Äôve been there. AAAAAAAAAly my AAAAAAers breast AAAAer was caught AAAly and a AAAAAAtomy was all that was reAAAAAA  My thoughts are with you and your wee laAA 
I was AAAAAAAed with breast AAAAer two years ago.  I had a lumpectomy, radiAAAAA and I have eight titanium clips in my breast.  Imagine how much that hurts.  They AAAly are awful but they serve a purpose and can save your life. 
So, she had a lumpectomy, which was not perAAAAA by the ND.  So she chose a AAAAAAed approach of AAAAAAAonal and AAAAAAAtive mediAAAA   You have the right to deAAA your own AAAAAment plan, I‚Äôm not AAAAAAing that. 
My cat who had the AAAAAAtomy also had his teeth extrAAAA yesterday. 6 of them! Since he came home he‚Äôs been upstairs sleeping. My pet AAAAAance make us pay an excess of ¬£135 but reAAAAA they‚Äôve deAAAA to add on 20% excess as well as the AAAed excess ü§¨ 
My AAAAer went against the advice of Aer oncologist and chose to work with an ND who AAAAAAAized in cancer. She AAAAAed the radiAAAA and chose a AAAAAAtomy and supplements. She is AAAAer free 18 years laAAA AAAAAAed consent is a AAman right.
