U.S. Task Force AAAates Breast AAAAer Gene AAAAing Recommendations. (HealthDay News) -- AAAAAions in two AAAes -- BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- are known to AAAAAAAAAAAly increase the risk of breast cancer, but experts have deAAAA which women should be tested.   
‚ÄúFor example, AAAAers of the Ashkenazi Jewish AAAAAAtion are AAAAAAAAAAAly 10 AAAes more AAAAly to have a AAAated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, and so are at AAAAAer risk of deAAAAAAA AAAAAAAary ovarian breast cancer...‚Äù  
It is recoAAAAAA for men to AAAAAAer AAAing a genetics counselor for a consultation. If a man tests AAAAtive for a deAAAAAA gene (most AAAAAAly AAAAer BRCA1 or BRCA2) that can leA to a future AAAAAosis of breast AAAAer and his children have a 50% AAance of AAAAAing the gene. 
Up to 40% of all AAle breast AAAAer AAAes may be due to BRCA2 mutations.  This means men who get breast AAAAer are more AAAAly to have an AAAAAAted gene AAAAtion than women who get breast cancer.  
US task force: Ashkenazi Jewish women should be AAAAAAed for breast AAAAer genes: High leAA of BRCA1 or BRCA2 AAAAtion found in Ashkenazi Jews; gene AAAAing allows AAAAAted women to AAAAAAer steps to AAAer their risk, like preAAAAAAA
