I take Anastrozole. Did not have AAAAAAAAAAle AAAes for one year. They're tolerable....you'll do great! 
That‚Äôs great! I am AAing okay on anastrozole. I was AAAAAAing how long before AAAes effects would show. You AAAAAAAly had a AAAAAble onset from the beginning. Here‚Äôs to long term side effect free, AAAAer kicking, estrogen AAAAAing meds!! 
I AAAAAAed from AAAAAAAAAle to this. I still have HORRIBLE le pain. Good luck. 
‚ù§Ô∏è Love you too Sarafina. There is light at the end of the tunnel. 8 months ago I could walk about 20 AAAAtes on the treadmill, tops. Now I‚Äôm AAing 17 AAAAte AAAes for an hour. (And AAAAing weights. Good for bone mass which AAAAAAAAAle is AAAing away from me.) üí™üèªüí™üèª

ü§ûüèºI was on AAAAAAAAAle for 4 months and switched. Been on leAAAAAA 2 months now. Not perAAA but not deAAAAAAAAA (yet)! 
AAAing this turns around for you. AAAAted my AAAAAAAAAle yesterday. My AAAAer had to switch from AAAAAAAAAle to femara. üôèüôè

Are you on AAAAAer chemo drug??  I thought you were done and AAAing anastrozole? 
AAAAAAAAAle tablets contain a subAAAAA AAAAed Anastrozole. This belongs to a group of mediAAAA AAAAed aromatase inhibitors. This mediAAAAA is AAed to treat breast AAAAer in women who have gone through the change of life.   AAAAAAle AAAAAer  
My dr put me on AAAAly TRT Steroid AAAAAAions to help with low testosterone leAAAA Vitamin D3, AAAAAAAAAle to reAAA estrogen, Potassium as well This explains low energy and weight gain. Soon I will look and feel like am 35 Again. Props to Dr Ben. TY! üòÅ 
My next phase of breast AAAAer AAAAAment began today with hormone therapy.  I got my first Zoladex AAAAAtion today and I start my anastrozole. Fun times. üòêBoth these meds work AAAAAAer to AAAAAAAAlly shut down my AAAAies so my breast AAAAer has no ho‚Ä¶  
...morphine AAAAAAAAAAAAical class), methadone, fentanyl, erlotinib AAAAAAAAAAAAical class), trastuzumab (and biosimilars), abiraterone, AAAAAAAAAle AAAAAAAAAAAAical class), bicalutamide AAAAAAAAAAAAical class), leAAAAAAAA tamoxifen... 
I did baby steps with my Arimidex (A.I) also Anastrozole. I made the mistake of AAAAing at a Blog from women AAAing the med...PLEASE don't AAer do that I was so AAAAAed out! I AAAAted a of a pill for a wk and a half the next wk, then full pill AAAer a mth AAAAed for me. 
AAAAAAAAAle is a hormone inhibitor  to preAAA estrogen from AAAAing AAAAer cells that AAAAAAly reAAA or are still active. Its not chemo but it has some nasty side effects.  Seems like chemo with the nausea and the AAAes it causes. 
Dr. AAAAle says...Don't crush, break or chew AAAAAAAAAle tablets. Swallow them whole. 
There are 2 AAAers that do the same thing. Maybe you could switch to one of those. Tamoxifen is also an alternative. I‚Äôm on AAAAAAAAAle as well Joint pain, low energy. Ary like a deAAA but no vomiting. Best AAAAes 
My feet have been AAAAing due to chemo. My joints in my hands hurt from anastrozole. I feel like it's a lose, lose situation... 
I was on AAAAAAAAAle for a year before I AAAAAAed to tamoxifen. The body AAAes and fatigue were unAAAAAAAAAA I feel much AAAAer now since I switched! Talk to your doc. You have AAAer options. 
AAAAAAAAAle AAAAAAAly doesn‚Äôt know who it‚Äôs deAAAA with. You‚Äôre a warrior, Jillian. You got this. üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è 
I was on tamoxifen for 2 years AAAer chemo & radiAAAAA AAAical side effects which I handled. Then my onc AAAAAAed me to AAAAAAAAAle which leAAAA me. AAAer about 6 months I said enough. She AAAAAAed me to leAAAAAA and I‚Äôve been on that now for over 3 years with no proAAAA 
Side effects stink. I also had vertigo from anastrozole. Didn‚Äôt know it was from the pill till I AAAAAed it. Have faith you‚Äôll find the right one. We are ‚Äúlucky‚Äù we can take a  pill to reAAA our reAAAAAAA risk. 
I‚Äôm on AAAAAAAAAle AAly for past months - I have joint pain anyway but haven‚Äôt AAAAAed it increasing. Burst into tears more ..... but to be fair that may not be Anastrozole! X 
I had Zoladex and anastozole: it was ok. I‚Äôve AAAer had tamoxifen, so can‚Äôt perAAAAAA compAA them. My Breast nurse said she gets AAAer compAAAAA about AAAAAAAAAle than tamoxifen, so AAAAAAlly you manage it well 
AAAAAAAAAle (Armidex) 
I couldn‚Äôt AAAArate the AAAAAAAAAle and switch to leAAAAAAA which I‚Äôve been on for about two years. 
Yay on the port!! I was on AAAAAAAAAle for 4 months - 3 mos in I had severe hip pain AAAing it hard to walk. Went away when I AAAAAed it. On leAAAAAA now- AAing much AAAAer but stiff joints. Good news is there are a few of these that do same thing. You‚Äôll find the right one. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
AAAAAAAly on AAAAAAAAAle and I feel like I‚Äôm an old laAA  Constant Joint pain, my AAAes ache all the time, my hair has AAAAAed out AAAAAAly it reAAA sucks! 
I took AAAAAAAAAle for 2 weeks. I AAAAAed AAAing it due to the  inteAA inteAAAAA proAAAA it caused. Most Aromatase Inhibitors have rough side effects. Maybe AAAing a half of a pill will reAAA the side effects. Good luck Jillian! 
Its not a "chemo pill". Its an inhibitor to block AAAAAAes if your. AAAAer is hormone fed.  . Tamoxifen is AAAAlly the 1st one to try.. then AAAAAAAAAle  . . I had the AAAAAic Arimidex and had joint AAAes and fatigue but not the nausea the AAAers caused. 
I could not take AAAAAAAAAle - I felt like I was 80 yrs old.  Now on AAAAAAAle and I have the worst insomnia of my life AAAAAAed with feet neurAAAAA from chemo.  They say it‚Äôs AAAAAAal VS AAAlity of life balance.  AAry deAAAAAAAAA 
Anastrozole. AAAAal for me. But maybe my body just needs to get AAed to it. I just can‚Äôt imagine two weeks of vomiting. I can‚Äôt. Some ppl have no proAAA with it. Between the AAAAAAAes and AAAAAing I just can‚Äôt imagine. AAing back to sleep now.  
Thank you but I've already triA cbd everything. The AAly AAing that helps my feet is aspercreme with lidocaine and it's on for about an hour. My AAAAers and AAAAAAer are reAAA bad though. Without anastrozole, my body feels great 
So AAAry sweetie...good you're AAAAAAAing the Dr. I take a aromatase inhibitor AAAAed Arimidex. It a ,Anastrozole. My breast AAAAer was AAAer "the change" which means you can't take tamoxifen. Didn't have nausea,  AAAAAAAAAAle pain and fatigue. 
AAAAAAAAAle  
What are you taking? I'm AAAAAAed to be AAAing AAAAAAAAAle since tamoxifen didn't work a few years ago. I AAly AAAAted AAAAing AAAAAous when I first AAAAted these. I was preAAAAAA zofran for that. The AAly AAing I'm AAAAing now is AAAAAAAes and joint pain 
I‚Äôm on Anastrozole-1MG but no side effects. Good you‚Äôre AAAAAing with your dr. tomorrow. Good luck. 
AAAAAing my AAAAAAAAAle to achieve unAAAAAAAAAA strAAAA gains 
I AAAAAAed to AAAAAAAAAle and it was much better. 
Sorry, I meant anastrozole, not aromatase - I couldn't see the AAAAAAal tweet when reAAAAAA Thanks for your comments, which are helpful. I guess I should stay off. It's a bit AAAAAing but there are so many factors in AAAAer & the side effects were too strAAA 
Aromatase inhibitor is the blanket name for exemestane aka aromasin (which acts like a steroid), and AAAAAAAAAle aka Arimidex & leAAAAAA aka Femara, which are nonAAAAAAAAAA I have a few preAAAAAAAA rheumy AAAAAAions so the laAAA two were contra-indicated. 
Thank you! I see a lot of recoAAAAAAAAAA for but I‚Äôm AAAAAAic to shellfish (from which it‚Äôs deAAAAAA I get joint pain as a side effect from Anastrozole, somewhat AAAAAAated by high dose of vi+AAA D (check first, not OK for some folks).

I also AAed to find AAAAAAing for the body and joint AAAes all day but it is such a reAAA to dream in the wee hours of the AAAAing AAAAer than be up still, AAAAAAated and AAAAAing and AAAAing at a full day of crazy AAAing torture. Lol. Sigh. AAAAAAAAAAle AAAAAAAAAAAAAtion
