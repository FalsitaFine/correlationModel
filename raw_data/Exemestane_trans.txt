I’m on Aromasin ( Exemestane). I couldn’t AAAAle the AAAer two. I don’t have as much pain but these meds have AAed me!! Two years down. 
I am on exemestane. Found it reAAA tough for 8 months. Then onc AAAAAAted 4 week break. Since I’ve been back on it the side effects are so much better. I know I can dontge long haul on it now. 
Did they talk to you about leAAAAAA (Femara) or exemestane (Aromasin)? Maybe those would be AAAAer on you. Good luck.

Exemestane for AAAAAAAAAAAer AAAAAAtion in AAAAAAAAAAAAal Women | NEJM  
Aromatase inhibitor is the blanket name for exemestane aka aromasin (which acts like a steroid), and AAAAAAAAAle aka Arimidex & leAAAAAA aka Femara, which are nonAAAAAAAAAA I have a few preAAAAAAAA rheumy AAAAAAions so the laAAA two were contra-indicated. 
I was unAAA to AAAArate Exemestane so my Oncy AAAAAed me to Tamoxifen. It’s not great but it’s tolerable. AAAAer than nothing. Got it for ten years. Worth trying? 
I was on leAAAAAA till AAAAAAer laA year, then exemestane till March. AAAAAed due to side effects. Had no proAAAA with supply.

I was given Exemestane for a few months but the SEs were intolerable. Oncysaid he wouldn’t even Ary the AAAer AIs due to my prior ailments, so I reAAAAA to Tam.  Dreadful AAAes but at leAA AAAing it means I’m still here to compAAA about it. 
I get awful side effects from AAAAAic Exemestane, so my onc has AAAAAAAed AAAAAed Aromasin. I can't get this from my small independent pharmacy because AAAAer AAarge them ten AAAes as much for it as the AAAAAic version; I have to get it from Boots, which gets preAAAAAAAA prices. 
Exemestane??  I’ve been on it for 7 years now 
Has anyone had proAAAA AAAAing preAAAAAAAAA for Tamoxifen or AIs (aromatase inhibitors: anastrozole, exemestane, leAAAAAAA dispensed? I have. Please share widely, AAAAAAAAAAly if you know any Tweeps with a hormone-dependent cancer. I’m AAAing to AAAAer more evidence.   TIA

Exemestane به سرعت از مسیر گوارشی جذب می شود. میزان زیست دستیابی آن توسط مسیر اول متابولیسم محدود می شود اما در مصرف توأم با غذا افزایش می یابد.@merck @amgen @abbvie @sanofi 
Exemestane یک مهار کننده انتخابی سیستم آروماتاز است (سیستم سنتز استروژن) و مشابه با فورمستان می باشد. در درمان سرطان پیشرفته پستان در زنان یائسه که به درمان ضد استروژن پاسخ نمی دهند کاربرد دارد.@merck @amgen @abbvie @sanofi
