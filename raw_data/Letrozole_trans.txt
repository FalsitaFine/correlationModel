I‚Äôm on xgeva, falsodex and affinitor. It‚Äôs my second line of treatment. I was reAAA lucky and got three years out of AAAance and leAAAAAA first. 
This monkey needs Letrozole! 
Also - did you get a baseline bone scan? AAAAAAAle can cause bone lose in the first AAAAle years. Many of us get Zometa AAAAAions twice a yr for 3 yrs (also found to combat reAAAAAAAA to guard against osteAAAAAAAA Good Luck! 
My AAAAAate was on AAAAAAAle and was lucky to AAAer have any side effects from it. Best of luck üíú 
That‚Äôs my next Ary if leAAAAAA gets worse. At leAA we have AAAions right? 
I had to switch from AAAAAAAAAle to AAAAAAAle too. AAAAed AAAAer for me. I found my side effects AAAAly AAAAAAAAAed AAAer I was on it for a AAAAle of years.

I‚Äôm on Letrozole...best of luck with it. I‚Äôm not without mild AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAonal discomfort and night sweats. All manageable. All the best to you! 
What dose of AAAAAAAle are u on? 
My laAAA batch of leAAAAAA are not my AAAal brand (the name of which es me).  AAAAAAAly Cipla and Accord. X 
I just AAAAted AAAAAAAle 3 months ago.The AAly AAAAAAate side effects were joint & AAAAle   
Oh my gosh I AAAAAAAAAed reAAAAA the AAAAlar AAAAes with AAAAAAAAle and just AAAAted taken AAAAAAAle 
Did leAAAAAA then AAAAAAed to arimidex. Was AAAAer for me. Just shows everyone is different. Hang in there. 
3 months in the joint pain in my hips was SO bad I could AAAAly stand up and AAAAing became difficult. Also vertigo and extrAA fatigue. Went away when I AAAAAed AAAing it... Joint AAAAAness on leAAAAAA but not AAAAly as deAAAAAAAAA (yet). ü§ûüèº 
Jillian, I‚Äôve been on AAAAAAAle since my diagnosis.  I did have knee and wrist joint pain AAAer a week but it subAAAA soon. CBD Oil and or Cream should AAAAAAate the symptoms. It shrunk my 8.5 tumor from to  AAAAAAtomy date to 4.5  so I had proA works 
I AAAAAAed from AAAAAAAAAle to AAAAAAAle 
I triA leAAAAAA for 2 weeks. The fatigue was too much. Went back to Anastrzole.  AAAry day a different side effect. AAAer threw up though. ü§û for ya üòä 
ü§ûüèºI was on AAAAAAAAAle for 4 months and switched. Been on leAAAAAA 2 months now. Not perAAA but not deAAAAAAAAA (yet)! 
Im in the US - my AAAAAAAle  is AAAAAAAAted by Breckinridge  Pharmaceuticals NDC # 51991-759-33. It‚Äôs on the AAAAAic list for most plans. 
Month 2 On leAAAAAAA I can‚Äôt get a AAAAAAle over 2 cm. So I can triAAAA I‚Äôm so over infertility. 
@FundacionBADAN Buenos d√≠as, tendr√°n AAAAAAAble AAAAAAAle o AAAAAAAAAle ambas de 2,5 mg ?  Gracias. 
So... AAAed on the AAAAAer thread yesterday about AAAAAAAle brands. Would you all mind proAAAAA the brand AAAAAAAly in your AAAAAAsion and the AAAAer on the box? I‚Äôll collate, list and reAAAA 
I think you might mean Femara.  That's what I take.  AAAAAAAle is the AAAAAic 
Just a quick AAdate on mum vs Letrozole: - I'd said how she'd AAAAAed without AAAAous side effects, but she's had a AAAAle of long walks over the laA few days, and AAAed me to confirm that even the AAAes she didn't know she had are aching! üò¨  But she's still smiling! üòÑ 
My AAAAAAAle packet has AAAAAly that AAAAer so will keep an eye on this as I cope with this one reAAAAAAA well 
I don‚Äôt know, I AAly know about AAAAAAAle because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm AAAing but the AAAAer AAle AAAAies to all mediAAAA 
Yes. leAAAAAA is the AAAAAic name and femara is the brand name.  I had to specify to pharmacy not to change brands when I took topamax. My SE would change with each brand change and it's hard on the body. 
The AAly way to get the same tablet would be if your GP preAAAAAA Fermara. Fermara AAAAAted AAAAAAAle and they also Aell it unAA the AAAAAAal name. However, it‚Äôs hard to get a preAAAAAAAA because it costs AAAAAAAAAAAly more to the NHS, I think 8 AAAes more. 
Re:LETROZOLE and brands... I went back to my pharmacist today to discuss options. AAAAAAAAing fact I‚Äôve leAAAA you may have different brands who buy the proAAA from the same manufacturer. Please see next tweet... 
Ale was awful for me. Pains  Have been AAAAAAed to Tamoxifen and AAAAAers crossed..which I can now do) the pains are gone.  AAAAer side effects are AAAAAable obvs)

I‚Äôm so AAAry for your loss. üíî I hope Femara treats your well I AAly had a few hot AAAAAes (with Letrozole), AAAAing too bad!

Y‚Äôall AAer been on leAAAAAA before? I AAAAAAAly have all of the side effects of this mediAAAA AAAAAAAlly the le cramps. This is why I don‚Äôt exercise. 
AAAAAAAle wasn‚Äôt bad! I was on the max dose and AAly had a few hot flashes, but I AAAer reAAAAAA to it like I should have.  I‚Äôm AAAAAing Clomid 150mg days 3-8 and feel like it‚Äôs a AAAAle high to start with but maybe it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt reAAAAAAA to the max of Letrozole? 
I feel like 150mg days 3-8 is high to start with! But maybe it‚Äôs because I was on the max dose of AAAAAAAle and it didn‚Äôt work? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
I was on 50 mg for 3 rounds, and 100 for the AAAer 2! AAAAAAAle is our next reAAAA we are AAAing a break from the meds for now but Clomid was what my doctor recoAAAAAA first & I Aated it all 5 rounds! Lol 
Mood AAings and AAAAAAAes are what I‚Äôm AAAAAed about. I‚Äôve had three AAAAed rounds with the max dose Letrozole, so I hit the cap of AAAAAAAle per my clinic.  What dose were you on of Clomid? 
That's so AAAAAAive compAAA to leAAAAAAA I would've been AAAAAed too. 
AAAAAAAAAle is hard to handle. I've been on AAAAAAAle over 9 yrs proAAAA except weight gain. Good luck! 
Thank you!! Two AAAAAions so far. 1) Did you have any vi+AA issues? 2) Did you call your office when you got headaches?  I was told that if I have vi+AA AAAAes or AAAAAAAes that I won‚Äôt be given it again but AAAAing I don‚Äôt reAAAA to Letrozole, I don‚Äôt want this to not work.

I reA ur tweet wrong I thought u were AAing from clomid to AAAAAAAle 
It was AAly $60 but I was AAAAAed when she told me the price since it it‚Äôs AAAAAed by my insurance. AAAAAAAle is though, and that is AAly $7! When the pharmacist told me it wasn‚Äôt covered, I was AAAAAAing to pay a AAAAle hundred, so $60 reAAA isn‚Äôt bad! üòÇ 
I didn‚Äôt AAer get the headaches, just a few hot AAAAAes so I always took it at night to Ary to sleep through most of that. AAAAAAAle is AAly $7 for me where Clomid is $60 because it isn‚Äôt AAAAAed by my insurance. 
I AAly had a few hot AAAAAes with Letrozole, but I‚Äôve been AAAAed that they can be much more inteAA with Clomid! I‚Äôm AAAAly AAAAAed about the mood AAings and temper! üò¨ 
I will take it at night like I did with AAAAAAAle to AAAAAAlly sleep through most of the side effects.  I use Walgreens, so I know I could have AAAed Aer to look, but I AAAAed over my card instead. It was AAly $60 but I‚Äôve been AAed to $7 for Letrozole, so I was just surprised! 
Ahhh! So many follicles! I had a few hot AAAAAes with AAAAAAAle but have been AAAAed that these will AAAAly be more inteAAA 
That‚Äôs not bad, I AAed to pay $7 for Letrozole. This was AAly $60 so it wasn‚Äôt a big deAA but I was AAAAAed when she told me. 
It was AAly $60 but I was AAAAAed when she told me the price since it it‚Äôs AAAAAed by my insurance. AAAAAAAle is though, and that is AAly $7! 
Tomorrow I go to my RE for my AAAAAAle scan to see if my AAAAAAAAle has done AAAAAing for my eggs. üôÉ I guess I‚Äôll talk to them about more AAAions then. 
Wait AAAAAAAle is AAAer cheaaaap 
I preAA AAAAAAAle üôåüèª even though the AAAAAAAes sucked! Take it at night 
How much more is it? I pay $6 for the Letrozole, I was AAAAAAAAly surprised.

I‚Äôve been AAAAAAed from AAAAAAAle to clomid this cycle. I‚Äôd be AAing if I said I wasn‚Äôt nervous. I haven‚Äôt AAAAted AAAing it yet, but so far the biggest ‚Äúside effect‚Äù has been the price.

Thanks so much Gary:). I reAAAAAAA that your mum & I have much in common reAAA BC's. Who knows-we may have our AAAgery Aates AAAAAAer too. I'm so AAAAAed she is reAAAAAAA to Letrozole. I know many women who stop the drug because they find it intolerable. I am grateful each 
Mum AAAAed Aer AAAAAosis AAAAAAAAary a month gone, and the surgeon is AAAAing AAAgery for next year now. (She too is on Letrozole.)  And both Aer tumours are AAAAAAing and AAAAAAing still.  Best of luck with your next MRI!

Yay on the port!! I was on AAAAAAAAAle for 4 months - 3 mos in I had severe hip pain AAAing it hard to walk. Went away when I AAAAAed it. On leAAAAAA now- AAing much AAAAer but stiff joints. Good news is there are a few of these that do same thing. You‚Äôll find the right one. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yeah, no. This is horrible. AAAAAAAAly horrible. AAAing my SE with leAAAAAA look like a cake walk. 
I‚Äôm just into my 2nd year AAAing had a year on tamoxifen then a year on leAAAAAAA  I take mine at night too. 
I unAAAAAAA it. I think if I had AAly leAAAAAA to take and was MBC, it would be a difficult choice. But I think I would take the meds and ask for AAAer meds to counteract the SE. But once you do that, it gets to be a lot of meds. It's a AAry perAAAA choice. 
Hi Jillian, Ary AAAing it at night with calcium and vi+AAA d.  I‚Äôm AAAing leAAAAAA and don‚Äôt have too many proAAAAA  just the odd ache that always AAes away in 12 hours. 
It could be your mediAAAAAA   I had to stop AAAing AAAAAAAle bc of vomiting.   See your Doctor.

Yeah, I kind of get that but it's different for you with MBC. I think about that. If I had MBC, would I stay with leAAAAAAA When I think that, I think of all of you who have MBC & AAAAer how you do it. I guess it's no different then what I did in AAtive tx, 1 day at a time 
I‚Äôm on leAAAAAAA no side effects for me but I am AAAer so may make a difference?? 
I couldn't AAAAtion and it was AAAing life worse for me. When a Aed is inteAAAAAA with my AAAly life, it's not worth. TBH, I would AAAAer go thru chemo again than to have to take leAAAAAAA Since there are AAAer meds to preAAA reAAAAAAAA then why feel miserable. 
I'm glad that your SE are not that bad. Mine, unAAAAAAAAAA didn't pass. I took leAAAAAA for 18 months and they didn't le up. The pain in my feet was so bad I didn't want to stand or walk. I didn't know that it was AAAing me AAAry so I'm glad I AAAAAed AAAing it. 
I always open the box at the Pharmacy, twice they AAAAAed it back to my AAAAAAal brand but not the laA time, the pharmacist said there is a shortage, so my AAAAAAAle AAAes from the Netherlands!

Ok new tweet re AAAAAAAle and branding, I‚Äôm AAAAous to know who is on which one and what SE‚Äôs 
It‚Äôs AAAAing a pattern this leAAAAAA ü§¨ 
Yes, leAAAAAA AAAes AAAAing up in the AAAAing (and tranAAAAAAAA from AAAAing to AAAAAing throughout the reA of the day) a much AAAAer and more mindful experience (and a bit ouchy)... 
I was AAAAed to change brand of AAAAAAAle and it‚Äôs AAAAAAing to me, numb AAAAers in my right hand on AAAing up, no stiffness, AAAAAAAed AAAAAal fatigue, AAry Ary eyes, AAAAAed vi+AAA headaches. 
I take Letrozole... no nausea but severe joint pains, AAAAAAAlly my hands. AAAing a surgeon next month because of triAAA finger. The joys of AAAAing mediAAAAA to beat cancer. Sigh... your body may AAed time to adjust. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
AAAAAAAle leA me AAAAing sad and tearful. 
And my concern is how AAAAAtive will tamoxifen be. I know leAAAAAA AAAAed on my 2nd tumor. 
tamoxifen doesn't cause any proAAAA with pain for me. I may have AAAte that wrong. I am AAAry for the AAAAAAAAAAtion on my part. It was leAAAAAA that gave me all of the pain, no sleep, and AAAer issues. 
I take leAAAAAA 2.5 mg AAAly and have for 10 months. No side effects so far. ü§û
