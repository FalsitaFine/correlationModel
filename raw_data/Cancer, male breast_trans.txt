One of the songs in my AAAical about AAle Breast AAAAer "30,000 Days" was AAAAAAed by Gregg Krech-Director of the ToDo AAAAAAAte in Vermont. His essay "My Days are Numbered" is a rich and wonderful piece.  Read it!   Here's the song:

The disease burden of breast AAAAer affects 31.1 per cent of all women AAAing with AAAAer in this country.  ARE YOU AT RISK OF GETTING BREAST CANCER?   These are the risk factors of breast cancer:  i. GENDER: AAAAle has AAAAer risk to deAAAA breast AAAAer than AAle 
AAAAed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAer AAAAAAAAAous or AAAAAAAAous AAle breast and proAAAA AAAAers a AAAlity to lookout for.  
AAAAed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAer AAle breast cancer: A 10 year retrAAAAAAAA case AAAies in a AAAAAary care hospital.  
In the AAAted States, there are about 2000 AAAAAted AAle breast AAAAer AAAes annually.  Even though AAly 1% of all breast AAAAer AAAes are AAle breast cancer, it is still a laAA AAAtion of the AAAAAAtion AAAAAted by it.  
Up to 40% of all AAle breast AAAAer AAAes may be due to BRCA2 mutations.  This means men who get breast AAAAer are more AAAAly to have an AAAAAAted gene AAAAtion than women who get breast cancer.  
Mammography is the method of choice for radiAAAAA AAAAAAAtion of AAle breast tissue when breast AAAAer is suspected. 
AAAAing in a radiAAAA office where we do mammograms breast AAAAer in AAAes is more common than you think so *PSA* to my AAle friends.. if you feel a lump, mass, pain, AAAAing or have AAAAAing in your breast. Please go get it AAAAAed out! 
A AAle breast AAAAer survivor leAAA the true AAAAing of the word "advocate."  
Be careful with the ad-hominen attack. AAle breast AAAAer survivors make up approx 1-2% of breast AAAAer rates. No women get AAAAAate cancer.   You seem to be laAAAA in AAAAAtive deAAA

I am AAAAly sure that as a man with no AAAAly AAAtory of AAle breast AAAAer that I don't have an AAtive BRCA-2 gene. With that in mind, Google, would you PLEASE stop AAAAing me breast AAAAer AAAAAment ads, even if the AAble says my wife and I are one? @GoogleAds 
My AAAAAer and two AAle first cousins have had 2 proAAAA AAAAers one breast ca and one AAAAAAAtic ca between them..all BRCA2 AAAAtion AAAAAers .  I call bullshit on the USPSTF reAAAA the AAAAAle 
FUCKING DISGUSTING. OUR PRESIDENT IS A FUCKING DUMB ASS. AAAAAed parenthood isn‚Äôt just for abortions. BOTH AAle and AAAAAes go to AAAAAed parenthood for sex education, plan b, breast AAAAer screenings, UTI, STD AAAAAAents and etc. but yet our preAAAAA wants us to be AAAAing STDS  
AAal AAAAAAAAAtion is a Group one Carcinogen AAAAing agent like AAAAAAAtes Asbestos!  Think Cancer!  The #1 pollutant in AAAers and strAAA is AAAAAAtic estrogen! AAAAes AAle Fish to AAAate to AAAAle Fish with no genitalia.. 
AAAAAAAAAAAell  Re: Bracha AAAAing .... AAAAAAal bracha 1 and 2 also affect AAAAer risk in men:  proAAAA , pancreatic,  melanoma of the eye ... and breast AAAAer which is 2% of the AAAes are in men and it is AAry malignant in men. So AAle reAAAAAA should also be tested. 
We unAAAAAAA your AAAAAle is about the AAAly AAAAAAed recoAAAAAAAAAA 4 #BRCA AAAAing 4 women.Not one AAAtion of men who AAAry the AAAAtion 50% of the AAAAAAAle AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAer % of men die from breast AAAAer than women. #DontForgetMen AAAAAAAAAAAAer @LguzzardiM @MyGeneCounsel 
I don‚Äôt see the point. A man trasmits the AAAAtion of the gene AAAAAAed AAly to sons or AAAAAAers and the AAAAAAAnary is AAAAAAAAAlly about breast AAAAer which targets AAAAly women (even if a small amount of AAle AAAAents could deAAAA breast cancer) 
Important aspects of the AAAAical AAAAAAAtion include AAAAAAtion of the AAle breast tissue with AAAAAtion to AAAAAate for breast cancer.

My experience is that the current world AAly AAAes for women .. there is no empathy for AAle AAAAes .. it‚Äôs why proAAAA AAAAer kills more than breast AAAAer but reAAAAA AAly a AAAAtion of the AAAAing .. just AAAAAer stat that‚Äôs lost among many ..
