  Autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately  1 in 59 children . ASD covers a range of conditions that doctors used to believe were different, including autism and Asperger's syndrome.  Behavioral symptoms often develop in early childhood, with  research  suggesting that parents and caregivers tend to notice some of these behaviors before a child's first birthday.  Despite this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that most autistic children do not receive a diagnosis until  after 4 years  of age.  In this article, we discuss the possible signs and symptoms of autism in 3-year old children.  Autism is one of the  more common  neurodevelopmental disorders. It is characterized by challenges with social interaction, communication, and flexibility in thinking and behavior.  Autistic people may have difficulty relating to those around them, developing friendships, and understanding other people's feelings. They may also have repetitive thoughts and perform repetitive behaviors.  Autistic people often have  higher rates  of co-occurring, or comorbid, conditions than the general population. Some of these conditions include:  According to some  research , 70% of autistic children have one co-occurring condition, while 41% have two or more, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), oppositional defiant disorder, or social anxiety.  There is no "cure" for autism, and many autistic people feel that ASD is an integral part of their identity. Doctors and therapists can help people manage their symptoms and maintain a happy, healthy life.  Some signs of autism in a 3-year-old might include:  Autistic children may not play with others. They may:  Autistic people experience a full range of emotions, but they typically read and express them differently from others.  An autistic 3-year old may:  Autism is characterized by difficulty communicating. At 3 years of age, an autistic child may:  Autistic children often display seemingly unusual or repetitive behaviors. They may:  Additional potential signs of autism in children include:  Not all autistic children show all these signs, and many neurotypical children occasionally demonstrate some of them. For this reason, a professional diagnosis is essential.  Autistic children may experience more or different challenges with communication, socialization, and behavior as they age. This is partly due to increasing social demands at school and in the community.  School-age children and teenagers may display some of the following:  ASD is  4 times  more common in boys than in girls.  Studies suggest that autistic girls may display different and more subtle symptoms. This may lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis and subsequent difficulties accessing effective treatment.  The authors of a  study  involving more than 800 autistic children reported that girls and boys showed differences in both brain structure and behavior. Girls tended to show less repetitive and restrictive behaviors.  Recent  research  also suggests that autistic girls and autistic boys tell stories differently. Girls may use more "cognitive process" words, such as "think" and "know," while previous studies suggested that all autistic children use fewer of these words.  Other theories about why ASD is considered to be less prevalent in females include:  Parents and caregivers who think that a child may be autistic should consult a doctor for a diagnosis or a referral to a specialist.  In order to know when to seek help, it is important to be aware of the milestones that a child should reach at each age. The CDC provide a  comprehensive list of milestones for 3-year old children .  A specialist — such as a developmental pediatrician or a child psychologist — can provide a formal diagnosis. These professionals will observe a child's behavior and track their development.  They will also test the child's hearing and vision and may perform additional tests to rule out other underlying conditions that could be causing symptoms.  For example, a child with hearing problems may also demonstrate social difficulties or not respond when spoken to.  A doctor may diagnose a specific level of autism. Each level requires a different type and amount of support.  Learn more about levels of autism in this article .  Early intervention is key for improving outcomes for autistic children. When they are young, children can learn helpful social, communication, and behavioral skills.  There are many options for autistic children, and these vary, depending on the child's symptoms. The best place to seek information is from the child's doctor.  The local school district should also be able to provide information about nearby resources, including early intervention programs.  Therapies and other forms of support that may be helpful for autistic children include:  It is essential to manage any other conditions that occur in children, teenagers, and adults with autism. These can include:  Autistic 3-year-olds will display noticeable signs and symptoms of the condition, particularly related to communication, social interaction, and behavior.  The earlier a child receives an accurate diagnosis and support, the better the outcome. A variety of therapies are available for autistic children and their families.  Parents and caregivers should speak to a doctor if they think that they are noticing signs of autism.  A doctor can evaluate the child and refer them to a specialist. They can also provide information about treatments and local and national resources.
