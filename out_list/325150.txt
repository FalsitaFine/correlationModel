 However, there are many types of cereal that people with  diabetes  can eat without worrying, as long as they take a few things into consideration.  Cereals are high in  carbohydrates , which can cause blood glucose levels to rise. For this reason, eating cereal may mean finding other ways to cut carbs from the diet.  Choosing the right cereal, such as one that does not contain lots of added sugar, can allow people with diabetes to enjoy cereal more often.  In this article, we discuss the best types of cereal for people with diabetes to eat, as well as ingredients to look for or avoid.  People with diabetes do not have to eliminate specific foods from their diet. Instead, the goal should be to eat a balanced, nutritious diet that includes both comfort foods and more healthful options.  Most cereals are high in carbs and sugar, both of which can raise blood glucose.  Some people follow a low-carb diet because  research  suggests that reducing carb intake may lower the risk of experiencing diabetes-related complications, aid weight loss, and help maintain healthy blood glucose levels.  People with diabetes who want to continue eating cereal should try the following strategies:  People with diabetes who want to enjoy cereal should consider the following options:  Although many cereals contain lots of sugar, which people with diabetes should treat as an occasional indulgence, some are rich in fiber and other nutrients. Choosing these foods can help control appetite.  Beneficial ingredients to look for include:  The authors of a  2012 meta-analysis  found that adopting a fiber-rich diet may lower fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels. HbA1c levels are a person's average blood sugar levels over several months.  Some ingredients to avoid in cereals include:  Cereals, especially those for children, can be very high in sugar.  An analysis by the Environmental Working Group  found that the average serving of cereal contains 9 grams of sugar.  When choosing a breakfast cereal, remember to check the carb content on the label, as some seemingly healthful cereals are still very high in carbs.  Having a high carb content is not necessarily bad, but for people with diabetes trying to monitor their carb intake, consuming a single bowl of cereal may take them very close to daily overall carb limits.  Eating smaller portions can help people with diabetes better control their blood glucose levels, especially when they eat high-carb foods such as cereal.  People with diabetes should not make portion decisions based on the size of the bowl, as this may mean eating very large portions. Instead, look at the portion size listed on the food's label and measure this amount or less.  The following are some other strategies for creating healthful portion sizes:  Eating a balanced diet is one of the most important strategies for managing diabetes, but that does not mean that people have to give up all the foods they love.  For help with choosing the right diet and finding the best cereal for their health, a person can talk to a doctor or dietitian.
