 They may also have an unusual response to heat, such as intense sweating or  anxiety . Heat intolerance is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition.  In this article, learn about the causes of heat intolerance, how to manage it, and when to see a doctor.  Heat intolerance is a generic symptom that can refer to a wide variety of responses to heat.  Some people with heat intolerance merely dislike the heat. Others feel uncomfortably hot at temperatures that other people find comfortable.  Some people can develop serious or even life-threatening symptoms in response to heat. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) , heat-related illnesses, such as heat  stroke , are responsible for more than 600 deaths in the United States each year.  People with heat intolerance need to be cautious in extreme heat, especially when they have other risk factors for heat-related illnesses.  The symptoms of heat intolerance can vary from person to person but may include:  People with certain chronic illnesses, such as  multiple sclerosis  (MS), may find that their  symptoms temporarily worsen in the heat . Some people with heat intolerance  are also cold intolerant .  Those with heat intolerance may have a disorder called dysautonomia that affects their autonomic nervous system.  The autonomic nervous system helps regulate automatic functions of the body, including the body's response to heat.  Several medical conditions can cause dysautonomia, including:  Other causes of heat intolerance include:  People with heat intolerance should discuss their symptoms with a doctor, especially if the symptoms appear suddenly or get progressively worse.  To treat heat intolerance, doctors will focus on treating any underlying medical conditions. Treatment will vary widely depending on the underlying condition. For example, people with Graves' disease may need radioiodine therapy to restore normal thyroid levels.  In many cases, heat intolerance is not fully preventable or treatable. A person with a spinal cord injury may have difficulty in extreme heat no matter what treatment they choose.  People may find that avoiding heat where possible and adopting strategies for safely managing any necessary time in hot conditions will help in the long term. Ways to manage heat intolerance include:  People with heat intolerance should carefully monitor themselves for signs of heat-related illness, such as:  Seek immediate medical attention for:  Managing medical conditions that cause heat intolerance can help prevent symptoms.  Talk to a doctor about staying safe in the heat and ask whether any medications are available to help the body regulate its temperature.  Some strategies that can reduce the risk of heat intolerance include:  As many people enjoy outdoor activities, such as swimming and warm-weather festivities, those with heat intolerance may feel frustrated and excluded. However, the right treatment strategy and a few cooling measures may make the heat feel more manageable.  Heat intolerance can provide clues to a person's overall health. It suggests that either the body may not be able to cool itself down properly, the brain may not be responding correctly to heat, or the heart and lungs may be struggling to work efficiently enough.  Anyone experiencing new or worsening heat intolerance should speak to a doctor, who can help diagnose the underlying problem.
