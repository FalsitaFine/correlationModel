  Back pain  is very common and there are many possible causes. The exact location of the pain is a key indicator of its cause. Left sided organ pain may originate from the kidneys, pancreas, colon, or uterus.  Lower left back pain, or left flank pain, refers to pain in the area above the hip or buttocks. People may feel a shooting pain under the skin or a dull ache inside the back, depending on the cause.  This article discusses some of the most common causes of pain in the lower left area of the back.  In most cases, lower back pain comes from a tissue injury. This could involve the muscles, bones, and ligaments in the back, spine, and surrounding areas. Injuries in one area can radiate out to other areas of the back.  Tissue injury pain is usually central, but it can occur to the left or right of the spine.  According to the  American Association of Neurological Surgeons , lower back strains are the most common cause of lower back pain — and  Penn Medicine  say that muscle strains are the most common cause of one sided lower back pain.

Poor posture or sitting in an awkward position for too long can also lead to pain in one side of the lower back.

Each disk has a firm outside, called the annulus fibrosis, and soft material inside, called the nucleus pulposus. A slipped disk involves fragments of the nucleus pushing through a weakness or tear in the outside of the disk, which then presses on the nerves.  A slipped disk can result from a sudden injury or develop over time due to wear and tear.  Symptoms may include:  A  kidney infection  can cause a dull, aching pain on one side in the lower back.
