 It is essential that people who decide to use the Plan B pill continue to take their  birth control  pills as usual unless a doctor advises otherwise. Taking both types of pill can provide a more lasting form of contraception.  The Plan B pill usually contains higher doses of hormones than birth control pills so taking both pills can cause some side effects.  According to the  manufacturers  of Plan B One-Step, people should resume taking birth control pills immediately after taking the Plan B pill.  Taking birth control pills after taking the Plan B pill can help to prevent unwanted pregnancy going forward.  Taking the Plan B pill in addition to continuing to take birth control pills may result in the next period being slightly different than usual.  For example, periods may:  If a person's period is more than a week later than expected after taking Plan B, they should take a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Anyone who has concerns about taking birth control pills or the Plan B pill should talk to a doctor.  It is possible to take the Plan B pill up to 3 days after unprotected sex, even though many people call it the "morning-after" pill. However, the sooner a person takes Plan B following unprotected intercourse, the more effective it is in preventing pregnancy.  The Plan B pill contains  1.5 milligrams  (mg) of the hormone levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel is a synthetic chemical that mimics the natural hormone  progesterone . It triggers several responses in the body that prevent pregnancy.  Levonorgestrel ensures that the body is:  There are many misconceptions regarding how the Plan B pill works. The pill is not an abortion pill as it does not destroy or damage a fetus. Instead, it prevents a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Once an embryo has implanted in the uterus, Plan B will not disrupt it or cause an abortion.  Anyone who has had unprotected sex or failure of their birth control method can take the Plan B pill. This pill is available without a prescription and has no age restrictions.  Some people should avoid taking Plan B, including those who are:  There are some potential side effects of taking the Plan B pill. Side effects are usually most significant in the 1â€“2 days after taking the pill and should subside after that.  A primary consequence of taking the pill is that the next period may be different regarding timing, flow, and side effects.  If a person's period is more than a week late, they should take a pregnancy test to ensure that they are not pregnant.  It is essential to understand that taking the Plan B pill does not protect people from  sexually transmitted infections  (STIs).  Taking Plan B can cause side effects in some people due to the elevated hormone levels in the body.  Typical side effects may include:  Some people may find that taking anti-nausea medications, such as Dramamine, or taking Plan B on a full stomach makes them less likely to experience stomach-related side effects.  The Plan B pill contains larger amounts of the hormones that are present in birth control pills.  Taking this emergency contraceptive causes a boost in the body's hormone levels, which increases the likelihood of preventing pregnancy.  However, there are medications and herbal supplements that could affect the way the Plan B pill works.  Medications that may make Plan B less effective include:  People should always ask a doctor or pharmacist about any medications they may be taking and how they could impact the effectiveness of Plan B medication.  People should continue taking birth control pills as usual even after taking the Plan B pill.  The Plan B pill is only intended to be an emergency medication, not a regular method of contraception.  If someone has difficulty maintaining a regular birth control pill schedule, they should talk to their doctor about other birth control methods, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs).
