 Adderall can be dangerous for people who take more than their prescribed dose and for those who use the drug without a prescription.  According to the  National Institutes of Health , the overdose rate for psychostimulant medications, including Adderall, is rising dramatically.  Overdosing on any medication can quickly become a medical emergency. Read on for some important information about the signs and symptoms of an Adderall overdose and what to do.  Overdose is a serious concern with Adderall. A person's risk depends on several factors, including:  There is no set dose at which a person will overdose. The effects of a high dose of the medication will vary significantly among individuals.  Signs and symptoms of potential Adderall overdose include:  Taking a high dose of Adderall can also affect the heart rhythm, causing an irregular heartbeat. It can even lead to a  heart attack .  Anyone who suspects that they or someone else has taken an overdose should call 911 or seek emergency help immediately.  While waiting for the emergency services, it is helpful to gather the following information:  It is vital to be honest with the doctors and first responders. Withholding information about a person's situation — including whether they have taken any illegal substances — can put their life in danger.  The medical professionals will try to minimize the damage of an overdose and reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. To do that, they need all of the available information.  If someone may have taken an overdose, it is crucial not to wait for them to "sleep it off" or make them vomit up the rest of the medication without speaking to a doctor or calling  Poison Control  first.  There is no standard dosage of Adderall. The dosage that someone takes to treat their condition depends on their age and response to the medication.  The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  have approved the use of Adderall in children as young as 3 years.  Children this young will usually start with  2.5 milligrams (mg)  each day. A doctor may raise the dosage in increments of 2.5 mg each week until the medication is effective.  Those 6 years and older usually start with 5 mg once or twice each day. Again, a doctor may raise the dose incrementally each week until it is effective. It is rare for a child to need to take more than 40 mg.  The dosage for someone with  narcolepsy  can range between 5 mg and 60 mg per day in divided doses, depending on the person's age and response to the medication.  Adults have a higher risk of complications than children when taking Adderall, even at regular doses. These risks include heart attack,  stroke , and sudden death.  Adderall can interact with alcohol and other drugs and medications in potentially dangerous ways.  Some people believe that Adderall's stimulant effects and alcohol's depressant effects will "balance each other out." In reality, Adderall can make the effects of alcohol more dangerous.  Adderall can make it hard for someone to feel the effects of alcohol, which may lead them to drink more than they might have otherwise. This higher intake makes  alcohol poisoning  more likely.  In addition, both alcohol and Adderall can affect the heart, increasing the risk for heart  arrhythmias , heart attacks,  high blood pressure , and stroke.  These serious effects can happen even in young, otherwise healthy people. It is vital to recognize that these risks still apply to people with a legitimate prescription for Adderall.  Adderall can interact with many other medications and over-the-counter drugs, including:  While it is never advisable for people to take medication that a doctor has not prescribed for them, including Adderall, it is vital to disclose recreational use or the use of "study drugs" to a doctor.  The doctor will not judge or report anyone to the police, but they can explain potential risks specific to an individual's medical situation and avoid prescribing a medication that might cause harmful interactions.  There are many different ways for doctors to treat an overdose. They will first need to make sure that they have accurate answers to the following questions:  There is no specific medication or treatment for an Adderall overdose. Instead, the doctor will need to provide supportive care and treat any symptoms or complications as they arise.  Treatment could include:  Adderall is a medication that doctors commonly prescribe to treat  ADHD  and narcolepsy. There is potential for the misuse of this drug both by people with a prescription for it and by those who use it recreationally or as a study drug.  It is possible to overdose on Adderall. The dose at which overdose occurs varies depending on many different factors, including a person's age and overall health.  Overdosing on Adderall is a potentially life-threatening situation, so it is essential to seek emergency help immediately.
