 Researchers state that roughly  20% of all cancers  in the United States have links to excess weight, physical inactivity, poor  nutrition , or excessive alcohol consumption.  In this article, learn about the links between diet and  cancer , as well as what to eat for cancer prevention and recovery.  Studies have not proven that there is a solid link between a specific diet and whether it may increase or decrease a person's chance of getting cancer.  It can be challenging to find direct links between cancer risk and certain foods because people eat a wide range of foods and cook and prepare them in a variety of ways.  Some research, however, suggests that eating certain foods could change a person's cancer risk. These foods include:  A  2018 study  of more than 100,000 people concluded that there was a link between consuming ultra-processed foods and a significant increase — more than 10% — of developing some types of cancer.  The authors looked at the consumption of highly processed foods, including:  Some meats may increase a person's risk of getting cancer.  The  authors of a meta-analysis of several studies  suggested that regular consumption of processed meat could cause a higher risk of bladder cancer. The authors did not find a link between nonprocessed red meat consumption and bladder cancer.  According to the  American Institute for Cancer Research , regularly eating any amount of processed meat increases the risk of  stomach cancer  and  colorectal cancer .  Processed meats include:  Other  research  has found that consuming more than 18 ounces, or three portions, of red meat per week, increases a person's risk of developing colorectal cancer, or cancer that affects the colon or rectum.  There is  strong evidence  that drinking alcohol can increase a person's risk of cancer in certain areas of the body, including:  Although experts do not know precisely why alcohol increases the risk of cancer, it could be due to chemicals in alcohol that damage DNA or weaken the body's ability to process and absorb nutrients.  The  American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR)  state that alcohol consumption may be even more harmful if a person also smokes cigarettes. They recommend not drinking at all or having no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.  More than two-thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .  Being overweight or obese increases the risk of health problems, such as  type 2 diabetes  and  heart disease , and it may also increase the risk of some cancer.  Experts believe excess weight may cause certain cancers for the following reasons:  People who are overweight or have obesity may have a higher risk of  these types of cancer :  A doctor can help a person determine a healthy weight for them and how to lose weight if necessary. An assessment may start with a body mass index ( BMI ) calculation and waist measurements.   Learn more about what the healthy weight range is by height and age here .  The strongest evidence for cancer prevention is in a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Though experts do not know the exact reasons for this effect, they speculate that the phytonutrients that are in these plant foods may help with the following:  Dietary changes cannot prevent all cancers, but eating plenty of nutrient rich fruits and vegetables could help prevent certain types of cancer.  The  AICR  recommend:  Many of the foods on this list are rich in fiber. Fiber is essential for healthy digestion and may help  lower the risk  of  colon cancer .   Vitamins , minerals, and  antioxidants  may help reduce cancer risk, but people should consume whole foods, not supplements.  Studies have not found that taking vitamins and other supplements helps reduce the risk of cancer. In fact, some studies showed an adverse effect when people took certain supplements.   The World Cancer Research Fund  state that high dose  beta carotene  supplements may increase the risk of  lung cancer .  Other research  suggests that high doses of vitamin E may increase the risk of  prostate cancer .  There is no specific diet for people who have cancer. Each person is different, and their type of cancer and treatment plan is unique.  Some people lose weight during cancer treatment and need extra  calories . Other people may wish to try to lose weight to achieve better health during treatment.  Some cancer treatments can make people nauseous or experience other side effects, so they may need to adjust their diet to find which foods do not upset their stomach.  Nonetheless, the  American Cancer Society  recommend these guidelines for people who are undergoing cancer treatment:  A doctor may recommend specific dietary changes to help with symptoms of cancer or the side effects of its treatments.  For instance, some people may need to switch to low fiber foods if they have  diarrhea , stomach cramps, or trouble with digestion.  People who have a  sore throat  may wish to eat foods that are soft and easy to swallow, such as cooked fruits and vegetables.  Eating a healthful diet is not a guarantee that a person will not develop cancer. However, it is a useful way to reduce the risk of many types of cancer and prevent other illnesses, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  With more evidence emerging about the cancer fighting ability of many fruits and vegetables, increasing a person's intake of these foods is a nutritious and safe way to reduce cancer risk.
