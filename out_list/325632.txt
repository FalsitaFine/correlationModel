Sertraline is sold under the brand name Zoloft, and there are also generic versions. It is available at most pharmacies.  Sertraline has the same mechanism of action as other SSRIs. It works by increasing the amount of  serotonin  that is available in the brain.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that is involved in regulating many elements of a person's daily life, including mood, sleep, rewards, learning, and memory.  Research has linked depression with low levels of serotonin.  Sertraline increases the amount of serotonin present in the brain, helping to reduce chemical imbalances and improve a person's overall mood.  Other SSRIs  include :  The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  note that people use sertraline to treat depression,  anxiety , and other mood disorders.  The main use of sertraline is to treat depression, though healthcare providers also prescribe this drug to help treat other conditions,  including :  A doctor may prescribe sertraline to treat other issues, such as sexual dysfunction or  headaches . Anyone interested in the range of uses should consult a doctor.  Sertraline is available as either an oral tablet or a liquid.  Typically, a person takes a dose in the morning or evening, once a day. People using it to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder may take it every day or only on select days of the month.  According to the  National Alliance on Mental Illness , sertraline comes in the following doses:  A person taking sertraline should follow these general guidelines:  When using the liquid, dilute it in a drink. According to the  National Library of Medicine , a person should mix 4 ounces (half a cup) of medication with one of the following beverages, then drink it immediately:  However, the right dosage will vary, based on a person's age and weight.  Typically, a healthcare provider will prescribe a low dose and increase the amount over time, but no more than once per week. It can take several weeks before a person feels any effects of sertraline.  People should not stop taking the drug without speaking to a doctor, even if they are feeling better. This may mean that the drug is working, and missing a dose can result in a return of symptoms.  Side effects can vary from person to person. Talk to a healthcare provider if severe side effects occur or if any side effects do not go away.  Common side effects of sertraline include:  These side effects usually go away after the first week or two. However, sexual dysfunction often does not reduce over time.   The package insert for Zoloft  states that it and other  antidepressants  can increase the risk of  suicidal thoughts  or actions in people aged 24 years or younger.  Pay close attention to any new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings, and speak to a healthcare provider about these changes.  Other severe side effects of sertraline may include:  In children, sertraline can cause a loss of weight and appetite. The pediatrician will likely monitor their weight.  Whenever possible, a person should come off sertraline gradually. Stopping the dosage suddenly  can cause  the following side effects:  Sertraline contains a warning for children, teens, and adults under 24 years of age. It states that sertraline may increase a person's suicidal thoughts or actions.  Parents and caregivers should make doctors aware of any family history of suicide. It is also important to recognize possible signs of suicidal thoughts or actions.  Adults can also experience suicidal thoughts in the first month or two of taking sertraline, as well as when the doctor increases the dosage.  Look carefully for signs such as:  In addition, it is important to pay close attention to side effects. If any are severe or do not go away, talk to a doctor.  People using sertraline may test positive on certain drug tests. Before taking a drug test, ask a healthcare professional for advice.  When first taking sertraline, avoid using heavy machinery or driving immediately after a dose, until it becomes clear how the body will react. Some people continue to experience dizziness, tiredness, or other effects that can impair judgment after doses.  Avoid drinking alcohol while taking sertraline.  Certain medications can interact with sertraline. An interaction can cause unwanted side effects or cause medications to be more or less potent than intended.  People should not take any monoamine oxidase inhibitors — another type of antidepressant, commonly called MAOIs — while taking sertraline or  up to 2 weeks  after stopping.  Taking sertraline along with other drugs that affect serotonin can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. This syndrome involves a range of symptoms, including agitation and loss of muscle coordination.  Some drugs that affect serotonin include:  People should not take pimozide while taking sertraline. Pimozide is an antipsychotic that helps treat Tourette's syndrome.  Also, use caution when taking medications such as ibuprofen, warfarin, and  aspirin . Sertraline can increase the risk of bleeding associated with these medications.  Sertraline is available in brand and generic forms. Most insurance plans and  Medicare  cover the cost of the generic version of sertraline. In this case, a person will pay only the associated medication cost of their insurance plan.  People who do not have insurance may be able to use coupons to reduce the cost of sertraline.  Doctors generally consider sertraline to be the preferred medication for the treatment of depression.  There is some evidence that sertraline is preferable to other antidepressants. For example, a  medical review  determined, based on almost 60 studies, that sertraline was more effective than other antidepressants. However, the researchers acknowledged that the majority of the studies were of low quality.  Each individual is different, and what works well for one person may not for another. Before taking sertraline, a person should discuss their medication history and family history with the doctor, who should describe the potential side effects of the drug. For some people, another option is more appropriate.  Sertraline is an antidepressant that can help treat depression and other mood disorders.  Some people find that taking sertraline helps them manage their symptoms. Others can experience side effects that are not manageable. If this happens, see a healthcare provider who can recommend alternatives, before stopping the medication.  Like other drugs, sertraline can cause mild to severe side effects. As with any treatment, discuss the benefits and potential side effects with a doctor before taking the medication.
