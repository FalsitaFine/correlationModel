 According to the  American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons , around 5% of people with  hemorrhoids  experience symptoms, such as pain, discomfort, and bleeding.  A small number of these people may require surgical treatment. However, people can usually treat hemorrhoids at home.  In this article, we cover the symptoms of bleeding hemorrhoids. We also provide information on home remedies, medical treatments, and when to see a doctor.  Bleeding hemorrhoids usually occur after a bowel movement.  A person may see traces or streaks of  blood on the tissue after wiping . Sometimes, small amounts of blood may be visible in the toilet bowl, or in the stool itself.  The blood from bleeding hemorrhoids is usually bright red. People should notify a doctor if the blood they see is darker, as this can indicate a problem higher up in the gastrointestinal tract.  Other hemorrhoid symptoms include:  Sometimes, a blood clot can develop within the hemorrhoid. This is called a  thrombosed hemorrhoid .  As a thrombosed hemorrhoid swells, pressure from surrounding tissues can cause it to rupture and bleed.  The blood from a thrombosed hemorrhoid tends to be dark and clotted. They are often very painful, and they usually require treatment.  Not all bleeding hemorrhoids require medical treatment.  If a person loses only a small amount of blood and their symptoms are mild, they may be able to treat the hemorrhoids at home.  Some home remedies include:  According to an article in the journal   Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery  , hemorrhoids are the most common reason people seek help from colon and rectal surgeons.  Signs and symptoms a person should see their doctor as quickly as possible include:  A person should see a doctor as soon as possible if they suspect that they have a thrombosed hemorrhoid.

Medical treatments for bleeding hemorrhoids depend on symptom severity and whether the hemorrhoid is internal or external.  Internal hemorrhoids form inside the rectum. External hemorrhoids form beneath the skin around the anus.
