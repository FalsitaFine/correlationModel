 Some chronic medical conditions can cause the muscles to wear out more quickly or cause a person to feel fatigued. In other cases, an infection may cause the muscles to falter.  If a person has a sudden, severe onset of muscle weakness, they should talk to a doctor.  Examples of conditions that cause muscle weakness include:  This occurs when a person's adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.  In addition to muscle weakness, other common symptoms of  Addison's disease  include:   Anemia  occurs when a person's hemoglobin levels are low, often due to an iron deficiency. Other symptoms of anemia include:  This diagnosis refers to unexplained fatigue, or fatigue that a doctor cannot relate to a medical condition. Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis.  People with  chronic fatigue syndrome  experience severe tiredness and sleep problems. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, pain, dizziness, and problems concentrating.  Electrolytes help ensure that the muscles, nerves, heart, and brain all function correctly. Having altered levels of electrolytes — such as  calcium ,  potassium , sodium, and  magnesium  — can cause muscle weakness.  Examples of electrolyte disorders include hypokalemia or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.  Risk factors for an electrolyte imbalance include:   Diabetes  occurs when the body does not make enough  insulin  or does not use insulin appropriately. It can cause nerve damage that may result in muscle weakness.  Diabetes can also lead to a variety of other symptoms related to muscle weakness, including:   Fibromyalgia  is a chronic condition that causes muscle pain and weakness in addition to other symptoms, such as:   Hypothyroidism , or an underactive thyroid, can cause muscle weakness and cramping. These symptoms may get worse with exercise and physical activity.  Other symptoms include:  A doctor can often diagnose this and other thyroid conditions with a blood test.  Problems with kidney function can cause metabolic waste products, such as creatinine, to build up in the muscles. This can result in muscle twitching and weakness.  Sleep disorders, such as  narcolepsy  and  insomnia , can result in daytime muscle weakness and fatigue.  A person who needs to stay in bed due to a medical condition may also experience muscle weakness. This results from not using the muscles as regularly as usual. A person may also be at risk of sleep problems.  Some infectious diseases can cause muscle weakness. They include:  Some conditions that affect the nervous system can cause muscle weakness. These conditions are often chronic and affect the way that a person's nerves transmit messages to their muscles.  Examples of neurological conditions that can cause muscle weakness include:  Neurological conditions are often progressive, which means that they get worse over time.  Some of these conditions also go through stages of remission, when symptoms lessen or even disappear, before flaring up again.  Some people experience muscle weakness as a result of medicines that they take.  Anyone experiencing muscle weakness as a side effect should speak to a doctor before stopping their medication.  Examples of medications that can cause muscle weakness include:  Some illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can also cause muscle weakness.  If a person's muscle weakness is not due to any of the issues above, or if they have particular risk factors, a doctor may consider rare causes when making their diagnosis.  Rare causes of muscle weakness include:  These conditions are not necessarily rare in the population, but muscle weakness is not always included among their common symptoms.  Multiple medical issues can cause muscle weakness, including neurological conditions, infections, and chronic illnesses.  To diagnose the underlying cause, a doctor will discuss a person's symptoms, medical history, and what makes the symptoms worse or better.  If a person experiences sudden, severe muscle weakness, they should seek immediate medical attention.
