 In this article, we outline the possible causes of a swollen gum around one tooth. We also provide information on treatment and when to see a dentist.  Possible causes of swollen gums around one tooth include:  Sometimes, food debris can become trapped between the tooth and the gumline. Flossing and brushing usually remove this debris.  If a person does not remove the debris, it can cause the gum around the tooth to swell. Over time, this may result in dental decay and  gum disease .  About  46%  of people aged 30 years or older in the United States show signs of gum disease. The medical term for this is periodontal disease.  Periodontal disease happens due to infection and  inflammation  of the gums that support and surround the teeth. These infections occur when a person has a buildup of plaque. Plaque hardens to form tartar, or calculus, which is more difficult to remove.  There are two stages of periodontal disease:   Gingivitis   When a person has gingivitis, their gums become swollen and inflamed. Other symptoms include:  Gingivitis is reversible, but without treatment, it can lead to  periodontitis .   Periodontitis   Periodontitis is the  later stage  of periodontal disease, during which the gums pull away or recede from the tooth. When this happens, an infection can damage the bone that supports the tooth, causing the tooth to loosen or even fall out.  A person with periodontitis will experience the following symptoms in addition to those of gingivitis:  A  dental abscess  is a collection of pus that forms within a tooth or its surrounding structures as a result of a bacterial infection.  There are two types of dental abscess:  Both types may cause gum swelling and redness around a tooth.  Other symptoms of a dental abscess include:  If the dental abscess is severe, a person may also experience:  The following home remedies can help reduce gum inflammation and improve gum health.  Antiseptic mouthwash cannot remove existing plaque and tartar, but it can help control the buildup of additional plaque bacteria.  Antiseptic mouthwash is available over the counter (OTC) at drugstores and pharmacies. Look for brands containing ingredients with strong antiseptic properties, such as cetylpyridinium chloride.  Sometimes, dentists may prescribe an antiseptic mouthwash containing  chlorhexidine , which  research  suggests is the most effective ingredient.  A  2016 study  investigated the effects of a saltwater rinse on gum wound healing.  For this study, researchers removed the gingival fibroblast cells from donors' teeth. These cells make up the connective tissues of the teeth.  After isolating the damaged cells, the researchers rinsed them in a saltwater solution for 2 minutes, three times per day.  They found that saltwater solutions with a concentration of 1.8% were most effective in improving the rate of wound healing.  People can make an effective  saltwater solution  by dissolving a level teaspoon of salt in a cup of cooled boiled water. They can rinse with the solution three to four times a day.  A  2014 study  investigated the antiplaque and antigingivitis effects of an herbal mouth rinse containing tea tree oil, clove, and basil. These ingredients have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.  The researchers divided the 40 participants into two groups. One group used a commercially available mouth rinse for 21 days, while the other group used the herbal mouth rinse.  The results of the herbal rinse were comparable to those of the commercial rinse. Participants in both groups showed improvements in various measures of gum health, including reduced plaque and gum inflammation.  Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can help reduce gum pain while a person undergoes treatment for dental abscesses or periodontal disease.  People can speak to their dentist about the following medical treatments:  Professional tooth cleaning removes tartar from the teeth, which can help reverse gingivitis.  During the cleaning, the dental hygienist uses special instruments to scrape off the tartar. They then smooth and polish the surface of the tooth to help prevent future plaque accumulation.  Root planing is a deep cleaning procedure that removes plaque and tartar from the roots of teeth. Dentists may refer to this removal as scaling or debridement.  People who undergo this procedure will often receive a local anesthetic.  Oral  antibiotics  are  usually effective  in treating dental abscesses. A person must also undergo dental treatment to address the cause of the abscess.  Sometimes, the infection may already have spread to other parts of the body. In very severe cases, a person may need to stay in the hospital and receive intravenous antibiotics.  In some cases, a dentist may need to make an incision in the abscess to remove the infected pus.  After drainage, the dentist will flush the area with saline. Other treatments may also be necessary.  A root canal is a dental procedure that involves removing bacteria from the infected tooth roots.  The dentist accesses the tooth roots via the crown, which is the visible part of the tooth. They then clean and fill the roots and crown. Some people may need an artificial crown to protect and restore the tooth.  Occasionally, a dentist may need to remove the infected tooth. This procedure will require local anesthesia.  People should have a dental checkup at least  once or twice a year , even if they do not have any tooth or gum symptoms.  Checkups allow the dentist to treat any problems in the early stages before they become more severe.  People should see a dentist between scheduled visits if they experience any of the following symptoms:  The best way to prevent gum inflammation is to practice good oral hygiene by:  A swollen gum around one tooth can occur for many reasons, including poor dental hygiene and periodontal disease.  People should visit the dentist if the swelling persists for more than a week. An earlier appointment is necessary if a person suspects a tooth abscess.  In many cases, a person can prevent gum swelling by practicing good oral hygiene, which involves brushing and flossing regularly and visiting the dentist for routine checkups.
