 Three bones — the shinbone, thighbone, and the patella — come together at the knee. Four ligaments help hold these bones in the right alignment, while tendons connect the bones to muscle. Cartilage acts as a shock absorber and promotes easy movement.  The ACL is one of two cross-shaped ligaments that connect the thighbone to the shinbone and help stabilize the knee.  Learn about the causes and symptoms of an ACL injury, as well as treatment options, here.  An ACL injury develops when the ACL, a ligament that links the thighbone and shinbone, stretches beyond its capacity and tears.  This type of injury frequently occurs during active sports that involve a lot of jumping and rapid starts and stops. More than  70% of ACL injuries  occur without any contact or blow to the knee.  ACL injuries affect  roughly 1 in 3,000 people  in the United States. Many people who sustain this type of injury are young and active. ACL injuries are also more common in females than in males, even among those who play the same sport.  When a person has an ACL injury, it is fairly common for there to be injuries to other parts of the knee, including the cartilage, tendons, and bones.  Along with significant pain, a key sign of an ACL injury is a "popping" sound, which occurs at the moment that the ACL is torn or stressed.  The symptoms of an ACL injury can include:  Although an individual of any age and fitness level can injure their ACL, these injuries usually occur during activity and in connection with:  ACL injuries are more common during sports that involve a lot of twisting and turning, such as:  Doctors categorize ACL injuries by their severity, as follows:  According to the  American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons , a partial tear is more rare than a complete tear.  A physician will assess the extent of the injury, evaluate the range of motion of the affected knee, and compare it to the other knee before making a diagnosis.  They may use X-rays to look for signs of bone damage or an  MRI  to conclusively identify a soft tissue injury, such as damage to the ACL.  After an ACL injury, a doctor may recommend:  Approaches to treatment vary, depending on the severity of the injury and the age and fitness of the person.  For young and otherwise healthy people, a doctor may recommend surgery to ensure that the person can fully resume their activities.  Surgery for an ACL injury involves miniature cameras and small incisions. This less invasive procedure is called an arthroscopy.  Usually, a surgeon removes the damaged portion of the ACL and grafts a new ligament into place. The graft can come from the injured individual's body, from a donor, or it may be synthetic.   Researchers  are studying new methods, such as bio-enhanced repair, to improve ACL surgery and reduce any associated risk of developing  arthritis  later.  If the doctor does not recommend surgery and the knee has retained stability, treatment may involve:  For people who play sports, it can take  7–9 months  before they are ready to return to their activities. During the recovery process, a person may need to use crutches or a knee brace.  Physical therapy is crucial for recovery from an ACL injury. Gentle stretches and strengthening exercises can help people:  While it is not always possible to prevent an ACL injury, the following tips may help:  Although it can take many months to recover from an ACL injury, with the right treatment and follow-up care, most people are able to return to their regular activities.  However, anyone who has experienced an ACL tear has a greater risk of developing osteoarthritis in the injured knee.  To reduce the risk of future knee injuries, people can do:  ACL injuries are common but serious. Most of these injuries take place during sports that involve sudden starts and stops, pivoting, and jumping. Females are more at risk of ACL injuries than males.  Treatment for an ACL injury may be limited to physical therapy and knee support, but a doctor may recommend surgery for more active people.  Recovery from an ACL injury can take months, and it may be more than 7 months before a person can play sports again.  A person who has had an ACL injury faces a greater risk of knee injuries in the future. It may help to take precautions and speak to a physical therapist about ways to reduce this risk.
