 This article lists 11 common causes of a rash on the inner thigh, along with possible treatment options and preventive techniques.  There are many possible reasons for an inner thigh rash. Both women and men are susceptible to inner thigh rashes, although the causes may vary between the sexes.  Potential causes include:  Atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as  eczema , causes red, itchy, and dry skin. The condition is more common in children, although it can occur at any age.  According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, an estimated  10 to 20 percent  of children worldwide have eczema, while just 1 to 3 percent of adults do.  Eczema may begin in the creases of the elbows or knees, but it often spreads to other areas of the body, including the inner thighs.  Over time, this skin condition may cause:  The inner thighs are especially prone to chafing because they can rub against one another or be irritated by clothing and pantyhose. Physical activities, such as running, may also lead to chafing.  Chafing is characterized by redness and blistering, although these symptoms should clear up once the cause of the chafing is addressed.  Contact dermatitis causes a rash to flare up following skin exposure to an irritant (irritant contact dermatitis) or an allergen (allergic contact dermatitis).  Irritant contact dermatitis may be caused by a variety of substances, including:  Allergic contact dermatitis is less common and results from exposure to substances such as:  The inner thighs may be especially prone to contact dermatitis because they come into close contact with clothing and detergents on a regular basis.   Heat rash , also known as miliaria or prickly heat, occurs when the pores become blocked and trap the sweat in the skin. Although it can be itchy and irritating, this skin rash is not dangerous.  It appears as tiny bumps on the skin and can affect any area of the body, from the back and chest to the groin and inner thighs. Symptoms usually resolve once the skin cools down.  Heat rash occurs in hot and humid environments and most commonly affects infants, children, and people on bedrest.  Hidradenitis suppurative (HS) is a rare rash that presents as  blackheads  or pimple-like bumps under the skin, which may burst and ooze  pus . It occurs where skin rubs against skin, so it is common in the inner thighs, groin, and armpits.  The cause of HS is unknown, but it is  most common  in people who:  HS affects three times more women than men, and it usually begins between  puberty  and  menopause , according to the  American Academy of Dermatology .  Despite the name, anyone can get jock itch, not just athletes. It is more common in men than women because men tend to sweat more, especially around the groin.  Caused by the same fungus that leads to athlete's foot, jock itch can itch, burn, and cause a flaky and scaly rash on the genitals, inner thighs, and buttocks.  This rash is highly contagious, especially through direct contact or by sharing towels or other items.  This common rash often appears in the spring and fall, with symptoms including small, scaly patches on the thighs, neck, upper arms, back, or chest.  Approximately  75 percent  of all cases of pityriasis rosea begin with a "herald patch," which is a single oval, scaly patch, followed within 2 weeks by more patches.  The condition affects women more than men and is more common in younger people. It rarely affects those over 60.  The cause of pityriasis rosea is not known, but the rash usually disappears completely within a few months.  Razor burn is caused by shaving, especially with unclean or dull razor blades, or when using improper shaving techniques.  Razor burn can develop on any part of the body that is shaved.  Swimmer's itch, medically known as cercarial dermatitis, is an allergic reaction to certain parasites that live in some lakes, ponds, and oceans.  Symptoms include tingling or burning skin, reddish  pimples , and small blisters that arise within days of swimming in infected water. Most cases do not require medical attention unless symptoms persist or get worse.  Swimmer's itch can occur anywhere in the world but occurs  more often  during the summer months. However, there is no risk of getting swimmer's itch from properly chlorinated pools.  A rash on the inner thigh resembles rashes in other areas of the body. Accompanying symptoms can include:  The rash may become more irritated if the thighs rub together or if a person is wearing tight clothing on the legs.  Some  sexually transmitted infections  (STIs) may cause a rash on the inner thigh. These include:  More than  1 out of every 6  Americans aged 14 to 49 years have genital  herpes . There is no cure for the condition, and many people with the virus do not have symptoms, although they can still spread the STI to others.  Symptoms include itchy and painful red bumps or blisters on the genitals, buttocks, and inner thighs.   Syphilis  is easy to treat in its early stages, but it can lead to serious complications when left untreated.  Initial symptoms include sores around the genitals or anus. At the second stage, known as secondary syphilis, its symptoms include  fever  and a skin rash that may appear on any part of the body, including the inner thighs.  If the rash is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever or pain, a person should see a doctor.  The underlying cause of a rash on the inner thighs will be diagnosed based on:  In some cases, a sample of the rash may be sent for further testing. Some people may be referred to a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin disorders).  The recommended treatment will depend on the cause of the rash. Not all rashes will require intervention, as they may clear up on their own.  When treatment is necessary, options include:  Several medications are available to treat a rash on the inner thigh, including:  Some of these medications are available for purchase over the counter or online, including  antifungals  and  antihistamines .  Depending on the type of inner thigh rash, one or more of the following home remedies may help:  To avoid getting an inner thigh rash:  A rash on the inner thigh is a common symptom that can have many underlying causes.
