 Spacers are especially useful for children who may otherwise have difficulty using an inhaler.  In this article, we discuss how spacers work, their benefits, and how to use and clean them effectively.  A spacer is a plastic tube that has a mouthpiece on one end. On the other end, a person can attach their inhaler. The inhaler is a device that delivers puffs of medication into the air so a person can breathe in the medicine.  Using a spacer extends the amount of time it takes for the medicine to enter the lungs. It also gives a person more time to inhale the medicine, meaning it can enter the lungs more effectively.  The spacer also concentrates the medicine into a tube, which prevents it from escaping into the air.  Spacers are especially advantageous for younger children or those starting out using an inhaler.  The following are the steps for using most inhalers and spacers:  After use, a person can clean the spacer as the manufacturer directs. People will usually remove the spacer's rubber end and wash the remaining parts in warm, soapy water. After rinsing, let the spacer air-dry thoroughly.  An individual can periodically show their doctor how they use an inhaler to make sure they are still following the proper techniques.      Below are some tips to ensure the most effective use of an inhaler and spacer:  A person can also ask their doctor or child's pediatrician about further advice specific to the type of medicine they use to ensure they are using the spacer most effectively.  Benefits of using a spacer with an inhaler include:  If a person is concerned that using their inhaler without a spacer is not delivering their medications effectively, a doctor may recommend a spacer.  An inhaler spacer is easy to use and increases the effectiveness of a person's inhaled  asthma  medications. If someone is not sure if they are using their spacer correctly, they should talk to their doctor.
