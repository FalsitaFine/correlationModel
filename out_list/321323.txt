 During the past 2 years in particular, we've been watching  MNT  move steadily from a ranking of somewhere in the thirties to alluringly close to the top 10. And this month, we received the report that we have finally arrived!  But what have we discovered along the way? We've learned that a devotion to the needs of our readers is the key to success, along with the ruthless pursuit of accuracy.  One of our company values is integrity, and this guiding principle has given us a place as an authority on health information.  I was curious to know what my fellow writers and editors have learned about health since working at  MNT . I've taken their responses and compiled a top 10 list:
  But what did we learn together this month, dear reader? Our News team reported that  two blood pressure drugs increase death risk  and that the  new guidelines for type 2 diabetes  lower blood sugar control levels.  Our writers also investigated  the state of cancer , asking if we are close to a cure.  You were also very interested in our article on whether it's possible to  unclog your arteries , which displays our interactive new body maps.   Home remedies to get rid of yellow teeth  also piqued your curiosity, as did the  top 10 foods for healthy eyes .  Earlier this month, Tim Newman and I attended the Wired Health conference in London, where we learned about the latest developments in health tech. I focused on  the rise of so-called Femtech , and Tim focused on  old tech, new ideas .  What are you curious about when it comes to your health?  Let us know , and we'll investigate for you. You can also contact us on  Twitter  and  Facebook .  Thank you for trusting us and helping  MNT  get to the top. Have a joyful, healthful start to the new Spring season!
