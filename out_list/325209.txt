 People have used lemongrass in traditional medicine for pain relief, stomach problems, and  fevers . Its  antioxidant , anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties may also give it other benefits.  In this article, learn about the possible benefits of lemongrass essential oil, as well as how to use it, and if it has any side effects.  Benefits of lemongrass oil may include:  The authors of a  2016 in vitro study  found lemongrass essential oil to be effective in fighting strains of the  Acinetobacter baumannii  bacteria. This multi-drug resistant bacteria can cause  pneumonia  and blood infections.  As the lemongrass essential oil was effective in inhibiting and killing off the bacteria, it could be a complementary therapy in the future for fighting illnesses that do not respond to  antibiotics .  In another  study , a concentration of 2% lemongrass essential oil gel inhibited the growth of bacteria that cause  gum disease . During this small study, 15 people with multiple sites of gum disease in their mouths took part.  The participants applied the gel to the location of gum disease along with nonsurgical dental therapy. The authors compared the results to a group just using nonsurgical dental therapy.  Lemongrass essential oil and nonsurgical dental therapy increased tissue healing more than nonsurgical dental therapy alone.  Chronic  inflammation  can cause many health problems, including  arthritis ,  diabetes , and some  cancers .  A  2014 study  showed lemongrass essential oil to have potent anti-inflammatory effects in mice with fungal infections.  The researchers concluded that, while more studies in humans are necessary, lemongrass essential oil may help treat skin inflammation in the future.  In the same  2014 study , the researchers looked at the in vitro effects of lemongrass essential oil on specific fungi, including  Candida albicans , which is responsible for yeast infections and thrush.  The essential oil had a "promising" antifungal effect, which leads the authors to state that it could have potential use in the treatment of fungal infections. More robust studies in humans are necessary, however, to confirm the effects.  Antioxidants help fight harmful free radicals and oxidative  stress  in the body, which may help reduce signs of aging and the risk of many diseases.  In a  2015 study , lemongrass was shown to have strong antioxidant properties and was effective in scavenging free radicals in an in vitro experiment.  The authors of an earlier  2011 study  also found that lemongrass oil mouthwash had antioxidant effects. The research involved 40 participants, including people with gum inflammation, or gingivitis.  The researchers tested the antioxidant effect of lemongrass oil mouthwash at three different concentration levels and found that is showed antioxidant activity at all concentrations.  These results may make it a useful addition to a regular dental hygiene routine.  Some research has suggested that lemongrass essential oil might help treat issues affecting the stomach.  A  2012 study  on an animal model looked at the effects of lemongrass essential oil on stomach ulcers resulting from ethanol and  aspirin  damage. Stomach ulcers are sores on the lining of the stomach that cause stomach pain.  The study found that lemongrass essential oil provided protection against damage in the stomach and could be a potential remedy for these types of ulcers.  Furthermore, eugenol, which is a component found in lemongrass essential oil,  may help relieve pain  and treat  stomach upsets  and  diarrhea .  Lemongrass essential oil may help reduce the symptoms of  rheumatoid arthritis , most likely due to its anti-inflammatory properties.  A  2017 study  looked at the effects of lemongrass essential oil on 30 people, between 35â€“70 years old, with rheumatoid arthritis.  The researchers gave each person 3 milligrams of lemongrass essential oil to apply for 30 days. Over time, the participants reported less pain.  A popular use for many diluted essential oils is for relaxation and massage.   One study  looked at the effects of lemongrass oil when people use it as a massage oil. In the study, researchers measured the participants'  pulse  and  blood pressure  before and after they had a massage with lemongrass oil. Each person received a massage once a week for 3 weeks.  The researchers found that the lemongrass oil massage reduced diastolic blood pressure but had no effect on their systolic blood pressure or pulse. They said it could have a "harmonizing effects" on the nervous system.  An  older study from 2009  argued that lemongrass essential oil might be effective for treating  headaches .  While there is limited evidence to support this, lemongrass is a common headache treatment in Australian traditional medicine.  People can buy lemongrass essential oil  online  or from a health food store. People should never apply undiluted essential oils on their skin or into their eyes, mouth, or ears.  The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  in the United States has approved lemongrass essential oil as safe when people use it correctly. Misusing essential oils is dangerous and can result in poisoning, skin burns, nausea, and illness in pets.  People can add lemongrass essential oil to a carrier oil, such as jojoba or  coconut oil , and massage it into the skin.  Adding several drops of the essential oil to boiling water and inhaling the steam through the nose, keeping the eyes closed, and covering the head with a towel is another way to use it.  People can also add lemongrass essential oil to an oil diffuser. Oil diffusers are available for purchase in stores and  online .  The concentration levels of essential oils when people vaporize them is unlikely to be dangerous for adults. However, people should be cautious about using diffusers around infants, children, pregnant women, or pets.  Essential oils are flammable, so people should take care to keep them away from an open flame.  Do not take lemongrass essential oil orally unless following the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Lemongrass essential oil may irritate the skin and cause a rash. To minimize the risk of skin irritation, a person should avoid applying lemongrass essential oil to the skin if:  To check before use, do a skin patch test on a small area of skin, then wait 24 hours to see if a reaction appears before applying the diluted oil more liberally.  Lemongrass essential oil can also cause dryness and stinging around the eyes, ears, mouth, and other mucous membranes, such as the genital area. For this reason, it is best not to use it on the face or put the oil into bathwater.  Research suggests lemongrass has many health benefits, often due to its antifungal, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties.  Many of the studies on lemongrass essential oil have been in test tubes or animal models, so further research is still necessary to find out more about the benefits of lemongrass essential oil on humans.  People should never apply undiluted essential oil directly to the skin or take the oil orally unless under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Using diluted lemongrass essential oil for massage, steam inhalation, or diffusing may help people relax and benefit from this traditional remedy.
