 Sometimes, a busted lip may bleed a lot because the mouth and surrounding areas contain many blood vessels. For this reason, it can be hard to know when to use at-home treatments and when to see a doctor.  In this article, we explain how a person can treat a busted lip at home, as well as when they should see a doctor for medical treatment.  The following at-home treatments may help someone if they have busted their lip:   1. Clean the lip   Rinse the lip with cold water and check whether any areas are cut and not just bruised. Usually, a person will not need to wash the area with soap, especially if the injury is to the inner lip.  However, a person can gently clean the outside of the mouth with soap and water if they wish.   2. Use saltwater for rinsing   People can try using warm  saltwater  as a rinsing solution.  It is important to rinse the saltwater off thoroughly after application and to avoid swallowing it.   3. Press the lips around a cooled, moistened tea bag   Teas naturally contain compounds called tannins, which  research  suggests can help stop bleeding by promoting blood clotting.   4. Apply a clean, cool compress   Immediately after an injury occurs, applying a cold, wet washcloth to the lip can help stop any bleeding in addition to soothing irritated tissues.  A person should apply gentle but firm pressure on the lip until the bleeding subsides, which should usually take about  5–10 minutes .   5. Try sucking on an ice pop or ice cube   These frozen foods will cool the mouth and reduce swelling. They are also suitable for children.   6. Apply a cloth-covered ice pack to the lips   During all waking hours in the first 24 hours after the injury, hold the ice pack against the lips every 2 hours for  10–15 minutes  at a time.  The cold temperature of the pack may help reduce swelling and minimize discomfort.   7. Take over-the-counter pain relievers   Medications for pain relief, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or  ibuprofen  (Advil), may reduce the pain of a busted lip.   8. Apply petroleum jelly    Petroleum jelly  (Vaseline) can help prevent moisture loss, stopping the lips from becoming dry and chapped, which may delay healing. People should always apply the jelly with clean hands.   9. Keep the head elevated   Elevating the head will allow blood to drain from it, and this may help reduce swelling. A person can raise their head while sleeping by placing extra pillows under it.  In addition to trying the above treatments, a person with a busted lip may wish to  eat soft foods  until their lip has had time to heal. Examples of soft foods to eat include:  It is best to avoid foods that are spicy, salty, or very acidic as these may cause pain when they come into contact with open wounds.  A person should see a doctor if a cut lip does not stop bleeding after applying constant pressure to the wound for  10 minutes .  A person should also see a doctor for a busted lip if they have:  Sometimes, a person may notice that the lip starts to show signs of infection a few days after the injury. An infected lip may be red, warm to the touch, draining  pus , or becoming more swollen. In this case, it is also important to see a doctor.

If a person falls or takes a blow to the face, they may bust their lip.  Other common causes of a busted lip include:  Wearing a protective mouthguard when participating in sporting activities can help reduce the likelihood of dental or mouth injuries. Mouthguards are available to  purchase online .  In most instances, people can treat a busted lip at home without seeking medical attention. However, if a busted lip gets worse instead of better or becomes infected, a person should see a doctor.  Keeping the lip clean and dry can help the wound heal as quickly as possible.
