 The  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)  say that nobody should eat unpasteurized raw eggs as they may contain bacteria that can cause illness.  However, in recent years, consumers have developed a  desire  for raw, untreated food products. This has contributed to the recent increase in foodborne parasitic infections.  In this article, we discuss whether it is safe to eat raw eggs.  Eggs are a  nutrient-dense food  when a person prepares them without adding solid fats, sugar, refined starches, or sodium.  A nutrient-dense food meets food group recommendations within calorie and sodium limits.  The USDA  do not recommend  that people eat raw, unpasteurized eggs, but state that people can eat in-shell pasteurized eggs without cooking them.  The  2015-2020 dietary guidelines  for Americans recommend using pasteurized eggs or egg products when preparing foods that require raw eggs, such as:  Some groceries sell pasteurized eggs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend keeping pasteurized eggs in the refrigerator.  Some people prefer to consume raw or undercooked eggs. However, the FDA estimate that about  79,000 people  develop foodborne illnesses, and 30 people die each year due to eating eggs contaminated with  Salmonella .  Some hens carry  Salmonella typhimurium  and  Salmonella enteritidis  in their reproductive organs.  Factors that  influence  the contamination of chicken eggs with  Salmonella  include:  Ways to control or prevent  Salmonella  include pasteurization and irradiation.  Pasteurization involves heating the eggs with hot water or hot air for a very specific period of time.  The USDA recommend heating eggs at a variety of temperatures to pasteurize individual parts of the egg. For example, egg yolks require heating at a minimum temperature of  60°C for 6.2 minutes .  Pasteurization significantly reduces  Salmonella  contamination but does not affect the nutritional quality or flavor of the egg.  Irradiation involves exposing the eggs to a dose of radiation, but this method can affect the quality of the egg.  In the United States, there is an  increasing interest  in raising backyard chickens. Researchers from the USDA surveyed chicken owners to find out how they care for and handle their flocks.  The researchers estimate that less than 50% of the chicken owners in Miami and Los Angeles and only 63.5% of chicken owners in Denver who answered the questionnaire were aware of the link between  Salmonella  infection and poultry.  One  study conducted in Australia  asked participants about their consumption of raw eggs. While 84% of people answered that they did not consume raw eggs, 86% of participants admitted to licking the raw batter from bowls, spoons, and spatulas.  The researchers highlighted that many people are unaware that consuming raw eggs can cause illness.  The researchers also looked at the food handling practices of a variety of people, finding that environmental health officers and food handlers had safer food handling habits than other professional people. This might indicate that educating people on how to handle food safely may improve food safety in the home.  People who consume raw or undercooked eggs can get  Salmonella  infection, which doctors also call salmonellosis. According to the FDA, the symptoms of a  Salmonella  infection occur within  12 to 72 hours  of eating contaminated food.  People who have  Salmonella  infection may experience the following symptoms:   The FDA  also note that infants, children, older adults, and pregnant women are at higher risk of getting sick from  Salmonella  infection.  People with a compromised immune system are also at higher risk of developing foodborne illnesses. Individuals with  diabetes ,  cancer ,  HIV  or  AIDS , or those who have transplanted organs should avoid consuming untreated raw eggs.  It is safer for people living with these conditions to consume pasteurized eggs.  In addition to food safety concerns, consuming any raw egg whites interferes with the body's ability to  absorb biotin .  Biotin  plays a critical role in fat and  carbohydrate  metabolism, and a deficiency can impair  insulin  function, which may worsen blood sugar management.  The  FDA recommend  the following tips to help people handle eggs safely:  The  USDA offer  tips on how to cook eggs:  The nutritional information of eggs will differ slightly depending on how people prepare them.  The following table from the USDA outlines the nutritional values of 1 large whole, raw egg.  Egg yolk is highly nutritious and provides most of the  essential amino acids  a person needs, as well many  vitamins  and other micronutrients, such as choline. One large egg provides approximately  27% of the daily value of choline .  Eggs also contain high amounts of fatty acids, which also help the body's metabolism.  Eggs are a nutritious, protein-rich food that people can cook in a variety of different ways. Some recipes may require raw eggs.  However, in these cases, the FDA recommend using pasteurized eggs. If a person prefers to use unpasteurized eggs, it is important to follow the FDA safe handling instructions found on egg cartons. For optimal biotin absorption, make sure to cook egg whites before eating them.  People can get very sick from eating raw eggs because of  Salmonella  contamination. Older adults, pregnant women, infants, and immunocompromised people should avoid eating raw eggs or foods that contain raw eggs.
