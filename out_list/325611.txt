 According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  chronic lower respiratory diseases — of which COPD is the most prevalent — were the "third leading cause of death in the United States in 2014."  Recognizing the end-stage symptoms of COPD can help a person cope and say goodbye to loved ones, make peace with their life, seek hospice care, and discuss their final plans.  In this article, we cover the signs and symptoms that may indicate that a person is nearing the end of their life. We also discuss how to help people feel calmer and more comfortable during this stage of their life.  COPD is terminal. People with COPD who do not die from another condition will usually die from COPD.  Until 2011, the  Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease  assessed the severity and stage of COPD using only forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).  FEV1 is a measure of how much air a person can exhale in a single breath. When it falls below 30% of the normal amount, a person may be in the end stages of COPD.  The new standard also looks at shortness of breath, as well as a person's history of acute COPD episodes, the impact of COPD on a their life, and other factors.  The stages of COPD  are as follows :  There are two ways to measure end-stage COPD. Clinical symptoms are those that testing at a doctor's office can reveal.  These symptoms can include:  During late-stage COPD, a person tends to experience more severe flare-ups. They may need to stay in the hospital during these flare-ups. Although a person will get a little better between flare-ups, they tend not to return to their previous condition.  Therefore, a person's health becomes steadily worse with each flare-up, and each flare-up tends to be worse than the last.  Some  other symptoms  a person might notice in late-stage COPD include:  Although COPD is terminal, people may not always die of the condition directly, or of oxygen deprivation.  Some people with COPD have other medical conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease. In fact, within 5 years of diagnosis, COPD is also an independent  risk factor  for sudden cardiac death.  Many treatment options are available to help a person with end-stage COPD cope with the pain and discomfort associated with the condition.  Although supplemental oxygen and COPD medications may help, they may not be as helpful as they were in the earlier stages.  Palliative care helps with pain and distress but will not treat the underlying condition.  Some  palliative care options include :  Many people with terminal conditions find significant help from hospice care. Hospices provide end-of-life care that focuses on helping the person feel comfortable, easing their discomfort, and supporting them to make peace with death.  Hospice providers prioritize the well-being of the patient and their desire for a good death, rather than preserving life at all costs.  For some people, anxiety about death is more painful than the physical discomfort of COPD. A person might worry about their legacy or their family, about spiritual matters, or whether they have lived a good life.  Some strategies that  may help include :  End-stage COPD can be overwhelming. Seeking appropriate palliative care can help with the physical discomfort of COPD.  It is normal for people to feel afraid or angry, and those who are close to death should not feel ashamed of these emotions.  A compassionate medical team and supportive hospice care can help a person feel comfortable and comforted during this stage of their life.
