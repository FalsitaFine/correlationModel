 But long term, severe, or disabling numbness and tingling is usually a sign of neurological conditions or nerve damage.  This article focuses on common causes and treatments for numbness and tingling, including  multiple sclerosis  (MS).  Numbness (lost, reduced, or altered sensation) and tingling (an odd prickling sensation) are types of temporary paresthesia.  These sensations commonly occur after sitting or standing in a particular position or even wearing tight clothing for too long. This puts pressure on nerves and blood vessels, reducing sensation.  Symptoms usually go away soon after the nerve pressure is reduced or relieved.  Numbness and tingling are two of the most common and early symptoms of MS.  MS often causes mild to severe numbness and tingling on the skin or certain parts of the body, including the:  The numbness and tingling symptoms of MS are rarely disabling or permanent. But severe numbness can make it difficult for a person to use the numb body part, which may interfere with everyday activities.  For example, numb hands can make holding things, typing, or self-care hard or impossible. If someone has numb feet or legs, walking and driving can be dangerous. People with numbness and tingling in their face may also mistakenly bite their tongue or inner mouth.  Severe numbness can make it hard to tell when things are very hot or cold, increasing the risk of burns and  frostbite .  Other conditions affecting the  central nervous system  that can cause numbness and tingling include:  Some other conditions that target specific parts of the body can cause numbness and tingling. Body parts include:  People with  diabetes  may experience  diabetic neuropathy , a type of nerve damage. It can occur over time as the metabolic effects of diabetes in the bloodstream damage nerves.   One-third to one-half  of people with diabetes have  peripheral neuropathy , a form that typically causes numbness and pain in the feet and legs, or less commonly, in the hands and arm.   Vitamin B12 deficiency , or pernicious  anemia , can cause nerve damage due to  low red blood cell levels  and reduced oxygen circulation. This can cause peripheral  neuropathy .  Alcoholic liver damage can cause peripheral neuropathy, affecting the hands and feet.  A  range of medications  can also cause peripheral neuropathy, such as:   Calcium  is vital to proper nerve function and blood flow.  Hypocalcemia , or calcium deficiency, can cause numbness and tingling in the fingers.   Carpal tunnel syndrome  can also cause numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and fingers. It occurs when the median nerve, a major nerve in the arm, becomes compressed in the space where it travels through the wrist.   Panic attacks , or sudden overwhelming periods of fear and  anxiety  without real danger,  can cause  a range of symptoms, including numbness or tingling in the hands.   Toothaches  and infections can compress facial nerves, causing numbness in the face and mouth.  To diagnose the cause of numbness and tingling, a doctor will review a person's medical history, do a physical examination, and ask questions about symptoms. They may then order laboratory tests, such as blood tests, to confirm or rule out potential causes.  In some cases, a doctor may request further testing, such as MRIs or other imaging tests. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help assess the extent and type of nerve damage, especially when neuropathy causes the tingling.  Treatment for numbness and tingling depends on its cause.  Numbness related to MS is usually relatively harmless and painless.   Niacin , a B complex  vitamin , may help reduce inflammation and related numbness.  In cases of severe or painful numbness, treatment may involve a short round of corticosteroids, which also quickens recovery by reducing inflammation.  Several medications designed to treat different conditions may also help reduce numbness and tingling associated with MS, such as:  Several different treatment plans may help reduce or manage numbness and tingling not related to MS, such as:  The best way to prevent numbness and tingling depends on the cause.  However, several lifestyle habits may help prevent or reduce numbness and tingling associated with MS, such as:  Prevention strategies for conditions other than MS that can cause numbness and tingling include:  See a doctor if numbness or tingling is persistent or occurs without an obvious cause, or if they accompany any of the following symptoms :  People who experience certain symptoms with numbness and tingling may need emergency medical attention. These symptoms include:  Many conditions can cause numbness and tingling, including MS.  Usually, the severity, frequency, and location of symptoms depend on the cause.  Although some causes have no cure, many have symptoms that are temporary, painless, or respond to at home care.  Several lifestyle habits, medications, and types of therapy can help reduce or prevent symptoms.  People with unexplained numbness and tingling should talk to a doctor as early as possible. The outlook for most conditions associated with numbness and tingling improves with early treatment. For example, treating MS early can help reduce the risk of severe complications, especially disability.
