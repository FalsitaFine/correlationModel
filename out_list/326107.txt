This can help reduce any swelling that is causing pain.  To  make  a salt water rinse:  Many teas contain plant compounds called tannins. According to some  research , tannins can reduce gum pain by killing bacteria that may irritate the gums.  Green, hibiscus, and black teas all contain significant quantities of tannins. These compounds cause the puckering feeling in the mouth after drinking strong tea or red wine.  Some teas contain ingredients that may help reduce  inflammation , including  ginger  and additional  chamomile .  To reduce gum pain, steep a tea bag in boiled water for a few minutes, then remove it, allowing it to cool slightly. While the bag is still warm, apply it directly to the site of the pain for around 5 minutes.  People have used herbs for their pain relieving properties for centuries.   Cloves ,  turmeric , and plants in the   Spilanthes   genus may help reduce pain, and a person can use these to form a paste that they can apply directly to the gums.

Clove ,  oregano , and  peppermint oils  all have properties that may help reduce inflammation, decrease pain, and improve circulation.  A person can make a spray containing essential oil and water and use this to reduce gum pain. To create the spray, add 4 or 5 drops of essential oil and 1 ounce of water to a clean spray bottle. Spray the mixture onto the site of the gum pain.  Benzocaine is a medication that can numb sore gums, and it is the main ingredient in common oral gels, such as Orajel and Anbesol.  It is important to follow the instructions on the label when using an oral gel to treat gum pain.  Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) can help ease dental and oral discomfort.  A person may see the best results when they combine over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers with home remedies, such as gargling with a salt water solution.  A person can often relieve mild-to-moderate gum pain at home. However, it is important to be aware of the warning signs that can indicate a potentially serious underlying health issue.  Some symptoms to look out for include:  The presence of any of these can suggest that a person has gum disease or another condition, such as  oral thrush , that requires professional treatment.
