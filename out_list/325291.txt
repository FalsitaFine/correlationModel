 Taking a probiotic supplement may help keep the intestinal flora balanced and promote a healthy body by boosting the digestive and immune systems.  While the research is still in the preliminary stages, some information suggests that probiotics could help a person lose weight, or that poor gut health has links to  obesity .  In this article, learn about probiotics and weight loss, including whether they work and how to use them.  There are many different microorganisms in and on the human body, mainly in the form of friendly bacteria. Researchers think that some of these bacteria may play a role in weight loss and gain.  In the gut, the beneficial bacteria help break down and digest food. They also help create nutrients and  vitamins  for the body to use. The probiotic bacteria feed on fibers and turn them into helpful compounds.  An unhealthy digestive system may lead to dysbiosis, which refers to an imbalance in the gut microbes.  When too many harmful microorganisms grow, there may not be enough of the helpful bacteria available to keep these harmful organisms in check. It also typically means the diversity of bacteria in the gut is lower.   Research from 2013  suggests that gut dysbiosis contributes to the development of obesity, though it may not be the underlying cause.  As the author of a  2015 study  notes, people at a healthy weight and people with obesity show marked differences in their gut flora.  Their research found that changing the gut flora in animals caused them to lose or gain weight accordingly. However, in humans, changing the gut flora did not result in weight loss or gain.  This evidence does suggest, however, that there is a shift in a person's gut flora when they gain weight. While changes are associated with obesity, they do not seem to be the underlying cause.  The researcher identified the following factors that can change a person's gut flora from a thin to an obese pattern:  There is a small body of evidence suggesting some probiotics may help people lose weight.  Research in   The British Journal of Nutrition   studied the effects that one type of probiotic,  Lactobacillus rhamnosus , had on people with obesity.  Women who took the probiotic supplement lost more weight during the study than women who took a  placebo . Additionally, the group taking a probiotic supplement continued to lose more weight in the weight-maintenance stage, after they finished dieting. The same effects did not occur in men, however.  Another  2013 study  looked at the effects of  Lactobacillus fermentum  and  Lactobacillus amylovorus .  During the study, individuals who were overweight but otherwise healthy ate yogurt that contained these  Lactobacillus  strains for 6 weeks. At the end of this period, the participants had lost an average of 3–4% body fat.   Researchers  have also examined effects of  Lactobacillus gasseri  for fat loss. In this study, people with extra belly fat who drank fermented milk products containing the helpful bacteria lost 8.2– 8.5% of their belly fat over 12 weeks.  However, when they stopped drinking the milk, all of this belly fat returned. This suggests probiotics can help people lose weight in some cases, but researchers still need to do more studies to back up this claim.  Low bacterial diversity may also influence obesity. For instance, the author of a  2015 review  found that there is a link between low gut flora diversity and  inflammation  in the body.  Low microbial diversity may also be a risk factor for problems associated with obesity, such as metabolic syndrome and  type 2 diabetes .  With these facts in mind, taking probiotics could benefit not just a person's weight loss efforts, but their overall health.  The most common probiotics are from the groups  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium . Each of these contain many different bacteria.  Probiotics may also contain other bacteria along with other organisms, such as the yeast  Saccharomyces boulardii .  The more popular bacteria on the market and most studied for their health benefits include:  However, the gut contains hundreds of different types of microorganisms, totaling over  100 trillion microbes .  There is no evidence that one type of probiotic can help a person lose weight more effectively than any other kind.  There are two different ways a person can add beneficial probiotics to their regular diet:  There are many probiotic supplements available. These products typically include strains of  Lactobacillus  or  Bifidobacterium  bacteria. Sometimes they contain both.  Probiotic supplements are available for purchase in health food stores, pharmacies, and  online .  Many foods also contain these healthful organisms. Yogurt may be the most well-known dietary source of probiotics. Yogurt is milk which ferments with specific  Lactobacillus  or  Bifidobacterium  strains.  Other fermented foods that often contain helpful bacteria include:  The  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  state that different probiotics may work in different ways, performing a wide variety of functions, including:  In addition to promoting healthy digestion, probiotics may have many other effects.  Research from 2015  suggests that a healthy gut colony is important for numerous body functions, such as:  Research on probiotics is still relatively new and growing. Scientists believe that there is a link between reduced bacterial gut diversity and obesity.  Also, some evidence in humans shows that some probiotics, such as some  Lactobacillus  strains, may help people lose weight or body fat.  However, probiotics are not a guaranteed weight loss strategy. Experts think they could be one part of a comprehensive weight loss program. They will not replace diet and exercise efforts.  The best way to use probiotics for overall health and weight loss may be to include them in a nutritious, varied diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, and other whole foods.
