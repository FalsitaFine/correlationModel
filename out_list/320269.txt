 Many people who have  depression  may experience a relapse or recurrence. According to one  review , it usually happens within 5 years, but it can occur weeks, months, or even many years after the first episode.  About half of the people who experience an episode of depression for the first time will remain well. For the other half, depression can return one or more times throughout their lives.  For those people who do experience repeat episodes of depression, the warning signs may be different each time.  Doctors and researchers do not know why some people experience a relapse, but others do not.  This article looks at the signs that depression is returning, its possible triggers, and ways to prevent, treat, and cope with this condition.  Many people experience sadness or a loss of interest in everyday activities as a normal part of life.  These feelings can stem from a variety of factors, such as the loss of a loved one or overwork.  However, if a person has these feelings almost daily for more than 2 weeks, and if they begin to affect work or social life, then they may be experiencing depression.  According to the  National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) , depression may affect around 7% of adults in the United States every year.  After the first episode of depression, the  American Psychiatric Association  say that depression can return in two ways.  A depression relapse happens when symptoms start to reappear or worsen again during recovery from an earlier episode. Relapse is most likely to occur within 2 months of stopping treatment for a previous episode.  A depression recurrence happens when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode. This is most common within the first 6 months. Around 20% of people will experience a recurrence, but this can rise when depression is severe.  After the first episode of depression has ended, the APA estimate that 50–85% of people will have at least one more episode of depression in their lifetimes. After two or three earlier episodes, the chances of depression returning are much higher.  Some depression-like disorders return frequently.  These include:   Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) :  SAD  is common during winter months.   Premenstrual dysphoric syndrome (PDS) :  PDS  is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome.  A person can often recognize the  same core warning signs  of depression they experienced during previous episodes, but sometimes, symptoms can be different.  Key  warning signs  of depression include:   Depressed mood : Feeling sad or anxious.   Loss of interest in activities : Taking less pleasure in hobbies, sex, and other interests that the individual usually enjoys.   Social withdrawal : Avoiding social situations and losing touch with friends.   Fatigue : Daily tasks, such as washing up and getting dressed, may feel more difficult and take longer.   Feeling agitated :  Agitation,  including restlessness and pacing.   Changes in sleep patterns : Insomnia or excessive sleeping.   Changes in appetite : This can lead to weight gain or loss.   Increased irritability : Getting annoyed more easily than usual.   Feelings of worthlessness and guilt : Thinking over past events.   Concentration and memory problems : Thoughts and speech may feel slower.   Physical aches and pains : Unexplained  headaches , stomach aches, or muscle pain.   Suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts : This may signal a severe depressive episode.  Specific triggers can cause a depressive episode in people who have a history of depression compared with those who have never experienced depression.  Common triggers for depression relapse or recurrence include:   Stressful life events  that happen during or after recovery: These can include family conflict, relationship changes, and grief.   Incomplete recovery  from the last episode of depression: If the person does not receive full treatment for the main symptoms, depression is  more likely  to return.   Stopping treatment early : Depression is not always a quick fix — sticking with treatment for 6 or more months after feeling better can reduce the risk of future depression.   Medical conditions : Conditions such as  diabetes ,  obesity , and  heart disease , can increase the risk of future depression.  These prevention strategies can help to stop depression from returning:   Keeping up with treatment : Finishing the full course of a prescribed medication can significantly reduce the risk of relapse, especially during the critical 6 months after treatment begins.   Mindfulness based therapies : Mindfulness can help a person understand any negative thought patterns and find ways of dealing with them. One study shows that practicing mindfulness three times a week may reduce depression relapse by up to  50%  within a year.   Educating friends and family : Telling friends and family what warning signs to look out for might help catch an episode early.   Prepare for a relapse : It may help to make a plan so that, if warning signs do appear, the individual can act upon them quickly. A doctor can help with this.  When worrying symptoms come back during treatment, it might mean that current treatment is not working as it should.  A doctor may recommend changing the treatment style or increasing the medication dosage.  Treatments that can help include:   Talking therapies : Interpersonal therapy (IPT),  cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT), or both may reduce the risk of depression returning.   Medication :  Antidepressants  or mood stabilizers can help some people. Following the doctor's recommendations for taking these drugs can help reduce the risk of a relapse.   Exercise : Keeping active can act as a  natural antidepressant . It releases endorphins that can improve mood. A 2015  review  of studies suggested that exercise could be as effective as  antidepressants  or psychotherapies in mild to moderate depression.   Electroconvulsive therapy : In some cases, a doctor may recommend  electroconvulsive therapy  (ECT). However, the use of ECT is controversial, as some experts  do not believe  that the benefits outweigh the risk of possible brain damage.  When a person has depression, it can be hard to find the motivation to carry out new or even everyday activities. Get  some tips here  to help manage this challenge.  Depression can have a severe impact on a person's life, but up to  70%  of people who seek treatment find their symptoms improve substantially.  The risk of depression returning is higher when the previous episode was more severe. Having other conditions, such as  anxiety  disorder,  personality disorder , or substance abuse, can also increase the risk.  Taking steps to prevent or treat each new episode that arises can improve the long term outlook for people who have depression.
