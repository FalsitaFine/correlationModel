 Medical treatments, regular exercise, and proper  nutrition  can also help a person manage their  arthritis  symptoms.  According to the  Arthritis Foundation , the condition affects over 50 million adults and 300,000 children in the United States. Natural remedies, such as herbs and supplements, might be safe, effective treatment options with few significant side effects.  However, research in the field of natural remedies remains limited. Scientific studies often use animal models or cell lines to test plant compounds. Very few clinical trials exist.  That said, the research that does exist shows promising results, and more research will reveal even more vital information for the medical community.  Continue reading this article to discover the six best herbs for arthritis.  The seeds of the  Borago officinalis  plant, or starflower, contain large quantities of an omega-6 fatty acid called gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). It also contains linolenic acid, the precursor of GLA.  When the body metabolizes it, GLA converts into a precursor of prostaglandin, an eicosanoid (or signaling molecule) that helps regulate immune responses in the body.  A  2011 systematic review  found moderate evidence to suggest that oils containing GLA, such as blackcurrant seed oil, evening primrose oil, and borage seed oil, may relieve pain and improve function in people who have  rheumatoid arthritis  (RA).  However, high concentrations of GLA may have a toxic effect on cells. A  2013 study  examined the effects of borage oil and GLA on cell cultures.  According to the findings, the authors recommended using borage seed oil instead of GLA because the former protects DNA from oxidative  stress .  Turmeric is a yellow spice and medicinal herb that originated in India. The orange pulp inside the stem contains the potent plant compound curcumin.  One  2018 article  cited findings from a number of animal studies and two trials suggesting that curcumin may reduce chronic  inflammation  due to RA.  However, the body cannot absorb large quantities of curcumin, which can limit its therapeutic application.  That being said, a compound called piperine — which is present in black pepper — can reduce inflammation and improve curcumin absorption, according to one  2018 study .   Uncaria tomentosa  ( U. tomentosa ), or "cat's claw," is a vine plant native to South and Central America.  Cat's claw may improve immune function and reduce inflammation. However, not enough high quality clinical trials exist to support these claims.  One older  clinical trial  did examine the anti-inflammatory effects of cat's claw among 40 people with RA. The authors reported a 53.2% reduction in joint pain among the participants who took  U. tomentosa  extract for 24 weeks.  Also, a  2015 study  found that cat's claw influences enzyme activity associated with arthritis. A more recent  2019 study  found that although  U. tomentosa  is probably safe, it did not have anti-inflammatory activity.  Cat's claw appears safe when a person takes it in small quantities. However, the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  advise that women who are pregnant should avoid taking cat's claw.  Oil distilled from eucalyptus leaves has antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. The flavonoids and tannins in eucalyptus leaves have  antioxidant  properties that may help reduce inflammation and pain.  A  2016 study  using cell cultures found that eucalyptus leaf extracts significantly reduced the levels of two inflammatory enzymes: interleukin-6 and  tumor  necrosis factor alpha.  People can purchase eucalyptus extract as an essential oil in many stores or  online . They can then add it to a warm bath or inhale it.  People with allergies should take care when using this herb, as many people are allergic to it.   Boswellia serrata , or frankincense, is the resin from the bark of the Boswellia tree. This resin has a strong aromatic quality, making it a popular ingredient in perfumes, incense, and essential oils.  Frankincense may also offer benefits for people with chronic inflammation. According to the  Arthritis Foundation , the active compounds in frankincense possess anti-inflammatory properties that could help relieve arthritis symptoms.  A  2016 review article  of several small scale clinical trials found evidence to support the use of frankincense and other Boswellian resin products for managing arthritis symptoms.  The authors state that although frankincense is not a cure for arthritis, 60–70% of people saw significant improvements in their symptoms when using it.  Aloe vera is a succulent plant popular for its health benefits. Many wound healing ointments and skin products contain aloe vera because of its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.  The compounds in aloe vera help remove free radicals from the body, much like antioxidants. These antioxidant functions also help reduce inflammation by preventing the production of inflammatory enzymes.  According to one  2018 article , the compounds in aloe vera produce anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints.  Although people can manage their symptoms with medical treatments, exercise, and proper nutrition, naturally occurring compounds in certain herbs could serve as complementary treatment options.  Current research shows promising results, but there is not enough scientific evidence to draw any definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the natural remedies in this article.  People should always speak with their doctor before trying any new supplements or natural remedies.
