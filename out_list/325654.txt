  Breast cancer  develops when the cells in the breast grow uncontrollably to form a  tumor . Malignant tumors can spread into surrounding tissue or even to distant parts of the body. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent this.  According to the  American Cancer Society (ACS) , breast cancer is the most common type of  cancer , other than non-melanoma  skin cancer , in females in the United States. Around  1 in 8  females in the U.S. will develop breast cancer at some point in their life.  Knowing the risk factors for breast cancer can help a person make decisions regarding screening and lifestyle habits.  In this article, we look at the link between age and the risk of breast cancer. We also discuss other breast cancer risk factors, as well as the risks and benefits of undergoing regular screening.  A person's risk of developing breast cancer increases as they get older. As people age, abnormal changes in their cells are more likely to occur.  Breast cancer is most common in females over the age of  50 years . According to the  National Cancer Institute (NCI) , doctors most often diagnose breast cancer in females aged 55–64 years.  Based on data from 2012–2016, the median age of diagnosis in females with breast cancer was  62 years old .  Although females are more likely to develop breast cancer after they reach the age of 50 years, younger women can also develop this condition.  According to the  NCI , the risk that a doctor will diagnose breast cancer in a female in the United States within the next 10 years is:  The  NCI  also report that of the 437,722 females that doctors diagnosed breast cancer in between 2012 and 2016:  Age is just one risk factor for developing breast cancer. Some other risk factors that people cannot control include:  Breast cancer can develop in both males and females. However, the  ACS report  that females are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than males.  Breasts contain fatty tissue and connective tissues. These types of tissue show up differently in mammograms. Doctors describe breasts that contain more connective than fatty tissues as being "mammographically dense."  Females with mammographically denser breasts are more likely to develop breast cancer than those of a similar age with less mammographically dense breasts.  The  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  genes make proteins involved in the repair of DNA in specific tissues, such as the breasts. Changes, or mutations, to these genes can significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.  According to the  ACS , females who inherit the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  gene mutation have a roughly 70% chance of developing breast cancer by the age of 80 years.  Females with these genetic mutations are also more likely develop breast cancer at a younger age and to have cancer in both breasts. They also have a higher risk of  ovarian cancer .  Changes to a number of other genes can also increase a person's risk of breast cancer.  Having a family history of breast cancer increases a person's risk of developing the condition themselves.  A female's risk  almost doubles  if they have a first degree relative who has had breast cancer and  triples  if they have two first degree relatives who have had it. First degree relatives are parents, siblings, and children and can include males.  The menstrual cycle increases levels of the female sex hormones  estrogen  and  progesterone  in the body.  Starting menstrual periods at a younger age or going through  menopause  at a later age raises the body's exposure to these hormones, which can increase a person's risk of breast cancer.  Those who start their menstrual period before the  age of 12 years  and those who go through menopause after the  age of 55 years  have an increased risk of breast cancer.  Females who have never given birth at full-term and those who had their first full-term pregnancy after the age of 30 years also have a higher risk of breast cancer, according to the  NCI .  Diethylstilbestrol is a drug that doctors prescribed to some pregnant women between  1940 and 1971  to prevent miscarriage. Women who took this drug while pregnant and any children they gave birth to have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer.  Females who have previously had breast cancer are at risk of developing a second breast cancer, either in the other breast or in a different part of the same breast. This is not the same as the first cancer returning.  Having a personal history of certain noncancerous breast conditions can also increase a person's risk of breast cancer. This can include conditions such as atypical hyperplasia, lobular  carcinoma  in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ.  Females who have had  radiation therapy  to the chest or breasts, such as for Hodgkin  lymphoma , before the  age of 30 years  have a higher chance of developing breast cancer.  This risk varies with age and is highest in people who were in their teens when they had radiation treatment. According to the  ACS , having radiation therapy after the age of 40 years does not seem to increase a person's risk of breast cancer.  A number of lifestyle factors can increase someone's risk of breast cancer. Being aware of these factors can help them reduce their breast cancer risk.  These lifestyle factors include:  The  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force  suggest that females aged 50–74 years who are at average risk of developing breast cancer should go for screening every 2 years.  Those aged 40–49 years, particularly those with a higher risk of breast cancer, should speak to their doctor about the risks and benefits of undergoing regular screening.  Doctors tend to use a mammogram to screen people for breast cancer. A mammogram is a breast X-ray that can help detect breast cancer early on, before it starts to produce symptoms.  Other exams available for people at a higher risk of breast cancer include:  There are both risks and benefits associated with regularly screening for breast cancer. Many people conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks, but getting screened is a personal decision.  The risks of screening for breast cancer include:  The main benefit of undergoing regular screening is that it increases the chance of detecting breast cancer in its early stages. Early diagnosis makes the treatment of breast cancer more effective, which can improve a person's outlook.  As people get older, their risk of breast cancer increases. Doctors most commonly diagnose breast cancer in females over the age of 50 years.  However, there are many other factors that can affect a person's risk of developing breast cancer.  A person has no control over some of these risk factors, such as family history and genetics. However, there are also a number of lifestyle factors — including alcohol consumption and physical activity levels — that people can change to help reduce their risk of this condition.  People can discuss their risk factors for breast cancer with a doctor, who can advise on the risks and benefits of undergoing regular screening.
