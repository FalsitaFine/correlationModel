 According to the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) , one large, hard-boiled egg contains around 78  calories .  Eggs were once a controversial choice due to concerns about saturated fats and  cholesterol , but researchers have since proved that eggs have a number of dietary benefits.  This article looks at the nutritional profile of eggs, as well as some of the latest research into the risks and benefits associated with eating eggs.  One large, hard-boiled egg weighing around 50 grams (g) contains the following nutrients, according to the  USDA :  However, the way a person cooks an egg slightly alters its nutritional profile. For example, the same 50 g of a whole, scrambled egg has around 4.99 g of protein and 36 IU of  vitamin D , according to the  USDA .  Eggs have many benefits — they are a good source of protein, fatty acids, choline, and  antioxidants . Eggs are also rich in  vitamin  D, a nutrient that does not occur naturally in many common foods.  Several research studies have tested the nutritional value of eggs as part of the daily diet.  For example, one study in   The FASEB Journal   included 26 participants, ages 60–75, with  obesity . The researchers asked them to eat either an egg based, high fat diet or a  carbohydrate  based, low fat diet for 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks, the scientists measured the participants' body fat composition. Those who ate three whole eggs per day in a low carbohydrate diet lost more fat than those who ate a high carbohydrate, low fat diet.  However, it is important to note that the Egg Nutrition Center funded this study.  A meta-analysis in the   Journal of the American College of Nutrition   examined seven research studies concerning egg consumption,  heart disease , and  stroke .  The researchers found that eating up to one egg per day helped reduce a person's risk of stroke, but they did not see an increase or a decrease in the participants' risk of heart disease.  However,  one study  in the journal  Heart  that included data from half a million adults found that eating an average of one egg per day was significantly associated with a lower risk of heart disease.  A study in   The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition   looked at the effects of a high egg diet versus a low egg diet in people with  diabetes . The team defined a high egg diet as eating two eggs per day on 6 days per week and a low egg diet as eating fewer than two eggs per week.  After 3 months, the researchers found that high egg consumption did not affect the cholesterol levels of the participants. They did find, however, that a high egg diet can increase satiety, or feelings of fullness.  Eggs can be a healthful addition to the diet. To reap the nutritional benefits, a person can incorporate them into a variety of meals.  Previous controversy surrounding eggs and their nutritional value concerned the amount of cholesterol in egg yolk. According to the  American Heart Association (AHA) , one large egg contains around 186 mg of cholesterol.  However, the secretaries of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA  removed the recommended daily limit  for cholesterol in 2016.  This followed recommendations from dietary advisory committees, which noted that research has not shown that dietary cholesterol — in foods such as eggs — poses a danger to heart health or cholesterol levels in the body.  Most recently, a 2019 study in the journal   Nutrients   found evidence to support the omission, concluding that eating eggs is not associated with excess cholesterol levels in the body. The results are based on the Hellenic National and Nutrition Health Survey, which asked more than 3,500 participants questions about their dietary habits.  If a person typically has a healthful diet and is mindful of their total daily intake of foods high in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol, eating cooked, whole eggs is unlikely to harm their health.  A bigger concern regarding egg consumption is that allergies are common, especially among children. In fact, according to the  American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology , around 2% of children are allergic to eggs.  Although many outgrow this allergy by the age of 16, some people experience reactions so severe that they cause difficulty breathing.  Some symptoms associated with an egg allergy include:  If a person suspects that they or someone they know is having an allergic reaction to eggs, they should seek medical aid.  People with severe egg allergies may need to carry an epinephrine injector pen to treat the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction.  A person can incorporate eggs into their diet in a variety of ways, such as by:  Eating hard-boiled, poached, or scrambled eggs can be very nutritious. To ensure that the eggs are a healthful addition, refrain from cooking them in butter or high fat oils.  Eggs can be a healthful addition to any meal, or they can serve as a snack. A large, hard-boiled egg contains only 78 calories, as well as protein and vital nutrients, such as vitamin D.  Although  nutrition  experts have expressed some concern surrounding eggs' cholesterol content, most current research suggests that eggs do not adversely affect people's cholesterol levels.  Anyone who has concerns about egg consumption, however, should speak with a doctor.
