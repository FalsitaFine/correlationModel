 According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , a person has a  heart attack  every 40 seconds in the United States.  A heart attack occurs when there is a blockage of blood flow to the heart. When a blockage to blood flow occurs, it can damage or even kill parts of the heart tissue.  While the movies may depict heart attacks as happening suddenly, many heart attacks begin slowly and have many warning signs.  The main heart attack symptoms include the following:  While both males and females may experience the primary heart attack signs and symptoms, the symptoms we have listed above are more common in males.  Females are more likely to experience additional signs and symptoms. These include:  A heart attack is a life-threatening medical emergency. If someone may be having a heart attack, a person should immediately call 911 for emergency help before doing anything else. Acting quickly can help save someone's life.  If a person is having a heart attack, calling 911 is often a better course of action than taking the individual to the emergency room. Paramedics typically reach a person faster than they can get to the emergency room themselves. Additionally, when paramedics arrive, they can begin lifesaving treatment immediately.  If the individual having the heart attack is unconscious, someone with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training should begin CPR.  If a defibrillator is available and someone knows how to use it, they should use the defibrillator after performing CPR if necessary.  If a person is alone and experiencing any symptoms of a heart attack, they should immediately call 911.  Next, they should take  aspirin  if available, and unlock their door, so that paramedics have access. Then they should lay down near the door but not blocking it, to make it easy for paramedics to find them.  A person should be aware of their risk factors so they can take steps to prevent a heart attack.  There are some heart attack risk factors that people can influence and others that they cannot.  Heart attack risk factors that people cannot influence include:  While people cannot influence the above risk factors, there are many risk factors that they can modify or treat to prevent a heart attack.  Modifiable risk factors for heart disease and heart attack include:  The best way to prevent a heart attack is to reduce any risk factors. People can reduce their chances of a heart attack by:  Additionally, a person should have regular checkups with their doctor. Regular checkups can help identify new risk factors for heart disease that a person may develop and monitor any existing ones they have.  Heart attacks are life-threatening medical emergencies that require immediate medical help. Knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack can help a person get the help they need as early as possible. Reducing risk factors for heart disease can help a person prevent a heart attack.
