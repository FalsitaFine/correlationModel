 According to the  American Academy of Dermatology , people with darker skin tones often do not receive a diagnosis until the  cancer  is in its later stages. This tends to be because the symptoms are harder to recognize.  Late stage diagnosis can be life threatening. According to the  Skin Cancer Foundation , the 5-year  melanoma  survival rate for black people in the United States is 65%, compared with 91% for white people.

In fact, according to the  Skin Cancer Foundation , among black people in the U.S., skin cancer makes up only 1–2% of all cases of cancer. In people with darker skin, such as Hispanic and Asian people, skin cancer makes up 4–5% and 2–4%, respectively, of all cases of cancer.  When skin cancer does occur, the most common places a  tumor  may develop include areas of lighter skin, such as:  In non-white people, the most common place for a tumor to develop is on the plantar, or the tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot. This accounts for  30–40%  of all skin cancer cases.  Three types of skin cancer are of particular concern to people with darker skin:  When a healthcare provider diagnoses it early, treatment can usually send all three types into remission. However, black people and those with darker skin tones are less likely to receive a cancer diagnosis early.  According to the  American Academy of Dermatology , for African American people:  People of any skin color can take the same steps to help prevent skin cancer.  Some basic steps include:  As well as taking steps to limit direct sun exposure, people of any skin color should perform self-examinations every month. In a self-examination, a person should check their body for potential tumors. To do so, they can:  When checking the skin, black people should look for some of the following symptoms:  Diagnosis can start at home.  People should check their skin every month for symptoms of skin cancer. If they notice that any are present, they should speak to their healthcare provider as soon as possible.  The doctor will examine the person's skin. If symptoms are already present in one area of skin, they will typically focus their attention on that area. They will likely ask general questions about a person's family and personal history of skin cancer.  If there is any suspicion of skin cancer, a doctor will perform an excisional biopsy. They may cut all or a portion of the area out of the skin. They will then send the tissue to a pathology laboratory, where experts will examine it under a microscope to determine whether or not it is cancerous.  After diagnosis, a doctor will recommend potential treatment options. The best treatment option for each person will depend on the type of cancer, as well as if or how far it has spread.  There are many treatment options available, including the surgical removal of the surrounding area to ensure that no cancer cells remain. Specifically, doctors may suggest Mohs surgery, wherein a surgeon will progressively remove thin layers of affected skin until healthy tissue remains. Doctors may also recommend  chemotherapy  or  radiation therapy .  Although it is not common, it is possible for black people and people with darker skin to develop skin cancer. Every person should check their skin regularly for abnormal growths or other changes.  When a person receives an early diagnosis, treatments are typically effective. However, among black people, doctors usually diagnose skin cancers in the later stages. This is often because the symptoms are more difficult to recognize. By this time, however, the cancer is harder to treat.  It is important that black people check common areas on their skin where skin cancer can occur, including the soles of their feet, the palms of their hands, the anogenital region, lower legs, and inside the mouth.
