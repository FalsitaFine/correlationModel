 The rule says that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.  Following the rule is a great way to remember to take frequent breaks. This should reduce eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for too long.  In this article, we describe how to use the 20-20-20 rule effectively. We also discuss the research behind the rule and other tips for preventing eye strain.  The 20-20-20 rule was designed by Californian optometrist Jeffrey Anshel as an easy reminder to take breaks and prevent eye strain, according to the   Optometry Times .   When following the rule, a person takes a 20-second break from looking at a screen every 20 minutes. During the break, the person focuses on an object 20 feet away, which relaxes the eye muscles.  The following methods can help a person to put this rule into practice:  Alternately, a person can benefit from closing their eyes for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Also, remembering to blink can prevent dry eye by encouraging tear production.  Anyone who spends the day sitting should periodically get up and walk around, to prevent back and neck pains.  Little scientific research has tested the effectiveness of the 20-20-20 rule, but both the  American Optometric Association  and the  American Academy of Ophthalmology  recommend it as a way to reduce eye strain.  Results of a  2013 study  involving 795 university students suggested that those who periodically refocused on distant objects while using the computer had fewer symptoms of computer vision syndrome, which include eye strain, watering or  dry eyes , and blurred vision.  Several symptoms can indicate eye strain, including:  Sitting in the same position for a long time has other harmful effects on the body. For example, it can cause neck, back, or shoulder pain.  Like the 20-20-20 rule, the following methods can help to reduce or prevent eye strain:  The strategies listed above require little time or financial commitment, but they can reduce eye strain related to using tablets, phones, and computers.  The 20-20-20 rule is an effective way to reduce eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for long periods.  If eye strain persists after a person has tried using the rule and other methods of prevention they should see a doctor, who can check for underlying conditions such as chronic dry eye.  The eye doctor may need to evaluate their vision and test the level of moisture in the eyes. When making recommendations, the doctor will take a person's occupation and overall eye health into account.
