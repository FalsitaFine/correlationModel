 There is no specific number of times a person should poop per day, since everyone's bowel habits are different.  Many people poop once or a few times per day or every couple of days.  Constipation , which is a symptom of many other conditions, refers to having fewer than  three bowel movements per week .  People who go more than a week without pooping may have severe constipation and should talk with a doctor.  Bowel habits depend on many factors, so it is hard to determine precisely how long it is safe to go without pooping.  However, it is generally best for a person to decide whether or not to seek medical attention for changed bowel habits based on their range of symptoms rather than just how long they have gone without pooping.  If any, or a combination, of the following symptoms accompany constipation, a person should seek medical care:  Older adults who usually have regular bowel habits and suddenly become unable to poop or have trouble pooping should also seek immediate medical care.  People who are unsure about why they are suddenly unable to poop or have difficulty pooping should also talk with a doctor. They should also talk to a doctor if they have any of the symptoms listed above for  3 consecutive months .  Severe or long-lasting constipation can cause or increase the risk of developing several health complications, including:  Experiencing short periods of constipation occasionally does not typically cause any complications, though it can be frustrating, stressful, and uncomfortable.  People who are finding it difficult to poop can usually treat the issue at home by trying a  few natural remedies :  Fiber helps make stool soft so it can pass through the colon more easily. Fiber-rich foods include beans, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and oats.  Moisture helps make stool soft and easier to pass. Everyone needs different amounts of liquid each day depending on factors such as age and activity level. However, many people require somewhere  between 1.5 and 2 liters  per day.  Regular physical activity can aid regular bowel movements. As little as  30 minutes  of brisk walking daily may help.  To maintain a regular habit, try pooping at the same time or times every day. For example, it may be best to try to poop around 15–45 minutes after breakfast, as eating helps the colon pass stool.  Some dietary supplements can cause constipation. Reduce the dosage of the supplement if symptoms occur and stop using it altogether if symptoms become severe.  Many medications contribute to constipation. If symptoms occur, people should talk with a doctor about changing the dosage or trying alternative medications.  Never stop taking a medication unless a doctor advises it or if symptoms are extremely severe.  Laxatives loosen stool in the colon, encouraging it to pass.  Types of laxative include fiber supplements (FiberCon, Metamucil), lubricants (Fleet), stimulants (Dulcolax, Correctol), osmotic agents such as milk of magnesia, and stool softeners (Colace, Docusate).  A doctor or pharmacist can help a person determine the laxative that is best for them. In many cases, stimulants are only necessary as a last resort. This is because they can lead to electrolyte imbalances and  dehydration , especially among pregnant women.  Many laxatives are available to  buy online .  Some foods, especially those with little or no fiber, can contribute to constipation. Foods to avoid include prepared and processed foods, red meat, fast food, most snack foods, candies, and sweets.  More research is needed, but it seems that a variety of herbal remedies may reduce constipation by acting as a bulking agent or laxative.  These include   Ficus carica , senna, aloe, cascara, and  rheum officinale .  Many herbal laxatives are available to  buy online .  Doctors may prescribe medications to treat severe or ongoing cases of constipation. These medications may include lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride.  Doctors may also advise that people with constipation due to muscle control issues undergo biofeedback therapy to retrain their muscles.  People with an anorectal blockage and those whose colons do not work properly may require surgery.  Many factors can influence a person's bowel habits. However, certain  risk factors , including some supplements and medical conditions, may cause a person to poop less often.  These risk factors — including lifestyle choices, medications, and conditions — include:  Pregnant women may poop less often than normal or have a hard time pooping, especially during the  last months of pregnancy . Women may also have a harder time pooping for a few months after giving birth.  This is because pregnancy causes changes in the gastrointestinal tract that predispose constipation. These changes include:  Pregnant women are also prone to constipation because they tend to get less physical activity and usually take supplements that have links to constipation, such as calcium and iron.  Lifestyle and dietary changes are common  first-line remedies  for constipation during pregnancy. However, if symptoms do not resolve with at-home care, pregnant women should talk with their doctor.  Pregnant women should also talk with their doctor if they have been pooping less than three times weekly for a few weeks or are experiencing severe symptoms.  Newborns with constipation always require medical attention. However, occasional, moderate constipation is not usually a cause for concern in children with otherwise normal bowel habits.  It is important to note that constipation has a different definition for children:  fewer than two bowel movements per week .  Children also experience changes in their bowel habits as they age. An infant's bowel movements may change significantly within their first weeks and months of life.  Knowing a child's normal bowel habits makes it more obvious when symptoms may require medical attention.  People should seek medical attention if their baby or child poops less than twice per week.  They should also seek medical care if the symptoms do not respond to at-home care, last more than 2 weeks, or occur alongside any of the following more serious  symptoms :  A person should talk with their doctor if they go more than a week without pooping, if the constipation lasts for more than 3 consecutive months, or if it does not respond to at-home treatment.  Children and pregnant women should receive medical care if they experience bowel symptoms for more than a few weeks. Babies and older adults also usually require medical attention if their bowel habits suddenly change significantly.
