 However, approximately  20%  of people experience more frequent  constipation . There are many different possible causes, ranging from a person's diet or medications to various medical conditions, such as  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) and  diabetes .  In most cases, people can use home remedies to help soften the stool and ease constipation.  In this article, we explain what causes hard stool, how to treat constipation, and when to see a doctor.  As the body digests a meal, the food moves through the colon, which absorbs excess water from it. When the food moves too slowly, the colon can absorb too much water, resulting in stools that are hard, dry, and difficult to pass.  Most healthy people have a bowel movement between  three times a day and three times a week . When the body digests food inefficiently, a person's normal pattern of bowel movements might slow down. When this causes a hard stool, a person may struggle to poop. While it remains in the colon, the stool may become even harder.  Some symptoms of hard stool include:  The Bristol stool chart can people to identify problems with bowel movements through the shape and consistency of their stool:  Many different issues can slow down digestion, hardening the stool.

The pain of passing the stool may cause a child to avoid having a bowel movement, which can make the problem worse.  Severe, chronic constipation in a child or baby can cause  encopresis . Encopresis causes very hard stools to block the intestines partially. This blockage can cause pain, and it may lead to  incontinence  or impair a child's ability to detect the need to use the bathroom.  Parents and caregivers should talk with a doctor before giving a child constipation medication. Some of these drugs, including enemas, often contain ingredients that may not be safe for children and babies.  While waiting to see the doctor, the following practices may help:  Occasional constipation is common and does not necessarily indicate an underlying health issue. However, it is best to see a doctor when:  Chronic, untreated constipation may lead to  complications , including  hemorrhoids ,  anal fissures ,  fecal impaction , and  rectal prolapse .  Hard stools can be painful and distracting. Children may find them embarrassing and scary, while parents and caregivers may worry about the effects of hard stools on toilet training.  Infrequent hard stools are usually just an inconvenience. People who experience this symptom from time to time may find it beneficial to eat more fruit and fiber.  When hard stools become a chronic problem, it is important to see a doctor. The right treatment can quickly resolve the issue, and it may prevent serious complications.
