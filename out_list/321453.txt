 The condition occurs when tissue resembling the lining of the uterus grows elsewhere in the body. When this endometrial tissue is present outside the uterus, a person is diagnosed with  endometriosis .  In this article, we explore the relationship between endometriosis and  fatigue . We also identify other causes of fatigue and a range of treatments.  Symptoms of endometriosis vary depending on where the endometrial tissue has grown. The condition has several stages. Each stage describes how much endometrial tissue is present and whether it has embedded into an organ or is growing on the surface.  A common symptom of endometriosis is heavy menstrual bleeding. Menstrual blood contains high levels of iron, and a person who regularly loses a lot of blood has a high risk of developing  anemia . This condition causes a person to feel tired all the time.  Some research has also linked endometriosis to  chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS). (CFS) is  more common  in women than men, and may be related to certain female reproductive issues.  A study from  2011  suggests that women who have experienced one or more of the following issues are more likely to develop CFS:  However, more research is needed in this area.  A person with fatigue feels extremely tired and weak. Their energy levels will be low.  People with endometriosis may feel especially fatigued around the time of their menstrual cycle.  Fatigue may have other symptoms, including:  When fatigue is severe, a person will often take long naps and feel faint when rising or moving too quickly.  Because there is little formal research on endometriosis fatigue, it may be difficult to tell whether the gynecological condition is causing the persistent tiredness.  Anyone who suspects that they have endometriosis fatigue should see a doctor. They will order a blood test to check the body's levels of iron, blood sugar, and thyroid hormones.  Possible causes of fatigue include:  Some adjustments to lifestyle can help a person to manage their fatigue. These include:  Fatigue may be linked to endometriosis, though more research is needed. Women with endometriosis who feel fatigued should consult a doctor to determine the underlying cause.  Changes to the lifestyle and diet can help to relieve symptoms of fatigue.
