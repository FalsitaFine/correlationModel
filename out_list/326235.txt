 Experts consider the normal body temperature to be around  98.6ºF  (37ºC), but it can vary by up to 0.9ºF (0.5ºC) depending on the time of day. Average body temperature also differs slightly from  person to person .  After intense physical activity or on a hot day, it is common to have a higher-than-normal body temperature. However, a body temperature of above  100.4ºF  (38ºC) could indicate  fever .  Hot outside temperatures, intense physical activity, illnesses that cause fever, and certain medications can all cause a high body temperature.  In this article, we discuss eight tips for reducing body heat and explain the most common causes of high body temperature.  It is possible to reduce body heat in two different ways: externally or internally.  Jumping into a cool pool is an example of external cooling, while drinking cold water helps reduce body temperature internally.  The human body is always regulating its temperature, and it can lower it in  four different ways :  A brain region called the hypothalamus is responsible for regulating body temperature. It checks the body's current temperature against its normal temperature and then regulates it.  When the body is too hot, regulation occurs through sweating to cool it down. When it is too cold, the hypothalamus triggers shivering to warm it up.  Although it may seem counterintuitive, eating spicy foods and engaging in activities that cause the body to sweat could potentially make it feel cooler in comparison with the outside temperature. This is because sweating reduces body temperature.  Below are eight tips for reducing body heat:  Drinking cool liquids, such as water or iced tea, can help reduce body temperature by cooling the body internally. The regular intake of fluids can also prevent  dehydration , which  can increase  body heat.  People can reduce their body temperature by moving to an area with a cooler external temperature. The body will lose heat by convection.  Swimming in cool water, taking a lukewarm bath, or applying cold water to the body can reduce body temperature. In these cases, body temperature will decrease as a result of conduction.  Applying cold water or ice to strategic points on the body where the veins are close to the surface — such as the wrists, neck, chest, and temples — can quickly lower the temperature of the blood running through these veins. This allows the body to feel cooler.  The body releases heat when it moves. In hot temperatures, a person is likely to feel less hot if they avoid heavy exercise and limit their movement.  Heat passes more easily through some fabrics than others. Natural fabrics, such as cotton and linen, allow heat to escape from the body more easily than synthetic fabrics, such as acrylic and nylon.  Depending on the cause of high body temperature, taking a supplement may help regulate body heat.  A  2018 study  that compared plant extracts found that both evening primrose oil and black cohosh were effective in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flashes in people going through perimenopause or  menopause .  Black cohosh also reduced the frequency of hot flashes.   Learn more about taking black cohosh during menopause here .  At times, high body heat may be due to an  overactive thyroid . When this is the case, a person might also notice other symptoms, such as a rapid heart rate, sweating,  jaundice , and confusion.  Anyone who thinks that they might have a thyroid issue should speak to a doctor.  The cause of high body temperature can be external or internal. Below, we list some of the main reasons why a person may feel hotter than usual:  Spending time outside in very hot weather can increase a person's body temperature, as can being in a hot indoor environment for extended periods. Wearing too many layers in either situation can also lead to an increase in body temperature.  Spending too much time in the sun can increase body heat or even lead to heatstroke, which some people call sunstroke.  Children and older adults are particularly at risk of heatstroke. Dehydration from spending too much time in the sun can further increase body heat. Therefore, it is important to drink lots of fluids and to rest after prolonged sun or heat exposure.  Doctors categorize overexposure to heat into  three levels : heat cramp, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke.  Heat cramp, although hard on the body, does not require medical attention. It tends to subside with plenty of rest and rehydration.  The symptoms of heat cramp include:  Heat exhaustion requires medical attention if the symptoms last for longer than an hour or get worse over time.  In addition to the symptoms of heat cramp, a person may experience:  Heatstroke is very serious and requires medical attention at a hospital.  The symptoms of heatstroke include those of heat cramp, as well as:   Learn more about the difference between heat exhaustion and heatstroke here .  When a person moves, they create energy. Heat is the body's way of releasing energy. To reduce body heat, a person can try temporarily moving less or only when necessary.  During perimenopause and menopause, people often experience hot flashes and night sweats, both of which temporarily elevate body temperature.  Medications and other drugs can raise a person's body temperature by affecting either heat loss or heat production.   Reducing heat loss    Some medications , including diuretics and anticholinergics, can impair the body's ability to lose heat by sweating.   Beta-blockers , neuroleptic drugs, inhaled anesthetics, and succinylcholine also decrease the body's ability to get rid of excess heat.   Increasing heat production   Some medications, hormones, and recreational drugs cause the body to produce  excess heat  because they increase the metabolic rate. These include:  Body temperature also increases in response to germs such as viruses and bacteria. An increased body temperature helps the body fight off invading illnesses, which is why a fever is often a sign of getting sick.  A  thyroid storm  is an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. It is a life threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. A thyroid storm may occur after illness, surgery, infection, or pregnancy.  As well as a very high body temperature, symptoms of a thyroid storm  include :  Malignant hyperthermia is a  genetic condition  that causes a person to have a severe reaction to certain medications and drugs.  The symptoms include a rapid or irregular heartbeat, a very high body temperature, and severe muscle spasms. People with this condition require immediate medical attention.

Caregivers should take children under 3 months of age to the doctor if they have a rectal temperature of  100.4ºF  (38ºC) or higher.  In children older than 3 months of age, a temperature of  102.2ºF  (39ºC) or a fever that lasts for longer than 24 hours requires medical attention.  People should visit a doctor if their body heat is higher than usual and they also have any of the following  symptoms :  The body can reduce its temperature by sweating or releasing heat into surrounding cooler air or water.  A person can also use a range of techniques to cool down. Not spending too much time in the sun, limiting movement, and wearing breathable fabrics can all be beneficial.  People should also take care to stay properly hydrated to avoid dehydration, which further increases body temperature.
