 The tragus is a favorite place to get an ear piercing, and while it can look great, this type of piercing can easily become infected if it is not cared for properly.  Tragus is also the name of the hair that grows in the ears.  Any piercing results in an open wound, which can take around 6 to 8 weeks to heal.  However, cartilage piercings, such as the tragus, can take much longer.  Many of the symptoms of infection appear as a result of the body's natural defense system trying to fight it off.  There are many reasons why an infection might develop:  A person who has had their tragus pierced should keep an eye out for the signs and symptoms of an infection so that it can be treated and managed.

A clean towel soaked in warm water can be helpful.  Alternatively, making a warm compress from chamomile tea bags can be very effective.  Applying a mild antibacterial cream can help kill off the bacteria that cause infection.  Make sure to change bed sheets regularly. This will reduce the number of bacteria that can come into contact with the ear while sleeping. Try to sleep on the side that is not pierced, so the wound does not press into sheets and pillows.  Keep hair tied back so it cannot get caught in the piercing and be careful when dressing or brushing hair.  Baths, swimming pools, and even long showers can all increase the risk of infection.
