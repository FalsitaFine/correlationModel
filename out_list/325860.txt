 Doctors may advocate eating a low fat diet because  calories  from fat are higher per gram than those from protein or  carbohydrates .  Some high fat foods — such as cookies, cakes, french fries, and greasy foods — may also have less nutritional value than healthful options such as fruits and vegetables.  Although fat is an essential part of a person's diet, there are "good fats" and "bad fats." Knowing the difference can help a person make informed choices about their meals.  In this article, we list some low fat foods and the benefits of a low-fat diet. We also look at a sample mix-and-match meal plan.  Low fat foods are those that have  30%  of their calories or less from fats. So, if a food contains fewer than 3 grams of fat per 100 calories, it is a low fat food.  To determine if a food is low fat, a person can read its  nutrition  label.  It is vital to read the part of the label that lists specific values, as many manufacturers label foods as "low fat" despite them having a relatively high fat content.  Examples of low fat foods a person can incorporate into their diet include:  Dairy products can be high in fat, but food manufacturers often offer lower fat versions. These include:  Some nondairy yogurts are also low fat.  Fruits and vegetables are naturally low fat. Choose fresh, frozen, or canned options.  Additional foods that can be a part of a low fat diet include:  When considering a low fat diet, it is important to remember that not all fat types are unhealthful. The key is to eat a varied diet of nutritious, natural foods and avoid those high in saturated or trans fats.  Manufacturers add saturated fats or trans fats to foods to extend their shelf life. These types of fat are also present in fried foods.  These types of fat can increase a person's low density lipoprotein  cholesterol , which, in turn,  can increase their risk  of  heart disease  and other health complications.  On the other hand, polyunsaturated — such as  omega-3  and omega-6 fatty acids — and monounsaturated fats can be beneficial to the body. These fats are present in nutritious foods such as:  Diets that are very high in fat from processed and fast foods tend to contain less nutritional value than lower fat diets that include a mix of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.  The American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the following as part of a healthful eating pattern:  The following meal plan is low in fat:   ChooseMyPlate.gov  also offers samples of 2-week menus of low fat meals.  When preparing meals, a person should be mindful of the amount of oil they use. Cooking the food in a non-stick pan may help reduce the amount necessary.  Adopting a low fat diet can be a positive approach to healthful eating. It is vital to keep eating beneficial fats, such as those from fish, avocado, and seeds.  Eliminating unhealthful fats, however, can have a positive impact on a person's weight, heart health, and overall well-being.  If a person has questions on the type of diet they should follow for their health, they should talk to their doctor.
