 When children and adolescents develop the condition, doctors diagnose them with juvenile psoriatic  arthritis  (JPsA).  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an autoimmune disorder.  Medical experts believe that it develops when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing them to grow too quickly. The cells then build up to form red patches of flaky, crusty skin.  The immune system can also attack a person's joints and cause pain and  inflammation .   Psoriasis  affects up to  7.5 million  people in the United States. Every year, doctors diagnose around  20,000  children aged under 10 years with the condition.  Research suggests that around  one-third  of the children or adolescents with psoriasis also develop arthritis.  In this article, we look at the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment of JPsA.  Symptoms of JPsA can vary considerably among individuals, but they may include:  The medical community does not fully understand what causes JPsA, but it believes that a combination of genetics and environmental triggers may be responsible.  However, a parent may not always pass on the condition to their child, and some people develop JPsA without having a family history of the condition.  Also, environmental factors may trigger the onset of JPsA or cause existing symptoms to flare up.  Possible triggers of psoriasis may include:  JPsA most often appears between the ages of  11 and 12 . Girls are more likely to develop it when they are younger and boys when they are older.  Some  research  suggests that young people who are overweight or obese may have an increased risk of developing JPsA.  Early diagnosis improves the chances of successful treatment and the prevention of joint damage and other complications.  A doctor specializing in pediatrics, a dermatologist, or a rheumatologist will begin by performing a physical examination.  They will also ask the parent or caregiver if there is a family history of psoriasis or arthritis.  If the young person has characteristic symptoms of psoriasis, such as the telltale rash, the diagnosis is usually straightforward.  Otherwise, the doctor can perform several diagnostic tests, such as:  Treatment for JPsA aims to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and prevent further damage to the joints.  Medications, dietary changes, and  physical therapy  can help.  A doctor may  recommend :  With some of these drugs, there is a risk of adverse effects. A doctor will prepare an individualized treatment plan to suit the person's needs.  Dietary changes can also help some people with JPsA. A doctor may recommend:  Physical therapies may include:  If a psoriatic rash is present, the doctor may recommend topical treatments, such as moisturizers and steroid creams or ointments.  Light therapy, or phototherapy, can also help to treat this type of rash. Sessions involve exposing the skin to ultraviolet light. A dermatologist will usually carry out these sessions in a clinic or hospital.  The following lifestyle changes can also help to reduce symptoms of JPsA:  JPsA is a long-term condition, but early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms and reduce flare-ups.  Receiving treatment at an early age can also help to minimize damage to joints and bones and reduce the risk of complications, such as  osteoporosis .  It is important for any child or adolescent with painful, swollen joints to see a doctor.
