 A cough occurs when the lungs or airways become irritated. The most common cause of a cough is the common cold, which does not usually require medical attention.  However, coughs that occur with other symptoms, such as dizziness, may require a trip to doctor. This is particularly important with more serious symptoms, such as coughing up blood.  This article will discuss when to see a doctor about a cough, as well as some possible causes of a persistent cough.  Different types of cough vary in how long they last.  For example :  Each cough can have a different cause, and some may require medical attention. Most acute coughs have less serious causes, such as a cold. It is not necessary to see a doctor in these cases.  However, subacute and chronic coughs could be a sign of something more serious that may require medical attention.  It is also important to see a doctor if the cough occurs with other, more serious symptoms, such as:  Below, we discuss several possible causes of a cough, as well as the other symptoms they may cause.  A common cold is one of the most  common  causes of an acute cough. Colds are the  result  of a respiratory virus, the most common being rhinovirus. Other symptoms of a cold can include:  It is not necessary to see a doctor for a cold, as the symptoms will usually go away on their own within a few days.  However, it is important to see a doctor if symptoms persist for longer than  10 days  or become severe.   Bronchitis  occurs when the airways in the lungs become inflamed. Acute bronchitis lasts for a  few days or weeks , but chronic bronchitis can persist for months.  Both types of bronchitis cause a cough that brings some mucus up with it. Other symptoms of bronchitis include:  It is possible to treat most cases of acute bronchitis at home with rest and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  such as ibuprofen.  Symptoms that last for longer than a couple of weeks could indicate chronic bronchitis, and this will require a trip to the doctor.   Pneumonia  is an  infection of the lungs . It causes the small air sacs in the lung, or alveoli, to become inflamed and fill with fluid. This makes it harder for the lungs to transfer oxygen to the bloodstream.  Pneumonia can cause a cough that brings up mucus. It may also lead to:  People with pneumonia should see a doctor for treatment. The condition can become severe in older people and may require hospitalization.   Asthma  is a  chronic lung disease  that makes it harder to breathe. In some people, certain triggers can bring on bouts of asthma, such as exposure to irritants in the environment. It can cause frequent coughing, especially at night.  Other symptoms of asthma include:  It is important to see a doctor about asthma. They can help a person find the right treatment and identify any triggers of the condition.  Allergies occur as a result of the immune system  overreacting  to a harmless substance, such as pollen or dust. Coming into contact with these substances can cause a range of symptoms, including:  In the most severe cases, allergies can cause  anaphylaxis , which is the rapid and simultaneous onset of several symptoms. Anaphylaxis can quickly become severe and requires immediate medical attention.  In most cases, allergies do not have a cure. The most effective way to deal with an allergy is to avoid triggers.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) is a  chronic condition  wherein stomach acid reaches the esophagus, which is the tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.  The most common symptom is  heartburn , or a burning sensation in the throat that can get worse when lying down. Other symptoms of GERD include:  There is no cure for GERD, but a doctor can make lifestyle recommendations that may help control symptoms. There are also medications available that can reduce discomfort.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of  lung disease  that affects breathing. Smoking tobacco is the main cause of COPD.  People with COPD can develop other conditions that worsen their symptoms, such as obstructive bronchiolitis or  emphysema .  Breathing difficulties, including shortness of breath and difficulty exhaling, are the main symptoms of COPD.  Other symptoms may include:  It is vital to see a doctor about COPD. Treatment will primarily involve giving up smoking and avoiding exposure to smoke or other irritants.  In more serious cases, an oxygen tank may be necessary to help support the lungs.  The outlook for a cough that will not go away depends on its cause. A cold can go away with no treatment within  7â€“10 days . However, other causes are lifelong conditions that may require ongoing management, such as GERD.  It is best to see a doctor if the cough persists for longer than 3 weeks or occurs with other, more serious symptoms, such as coughing up blood.
