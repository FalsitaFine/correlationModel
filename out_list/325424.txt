 In this article, we discuss some of the potential causes of lower back and  leg pain . We also cover when to see a doctor.  Sprains and strains to the muscles of the lower back can cause pain. Sometimes, this pain may radiate to the buttocks or restrict a person's range of motion. Strains and sprains can also lead to muscle spasms.  Sprains and strains in the lower back can result from sports injuries, overusing or overstretching the back, or lifting heavy objects improperly.  A person can often treat back strains and sprains at home with rest, ice or  heat packs , gentle stretching, and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  Doctors may recommend  physical therapy  for people with more severe symptoms.  Poor posture when standing or sitting, particularly while working at a desk or computer, can  stress  the back over time, which can lead to lower  back pain  or increase the risk of developing conditions that can cause back and leg problems.  Steps that a person can take to reduce and prevent lower back pain include:   Fibromyalgia  is a chronic condition that causes widespread stiffness and pain, which can affect the back and legs. People may find that this pain comes and goes in cycles or gets worse over time.  Other symptoms of fibromyalgia can include:  The right treatment varies from person to person, but options can include:  Research into effective treatment options continues, and many people with fibromyalgia try several treatments before they find one that works for them.   Arthritis  is a group of conditions that cause the joints to become inflamed and painful. Joint  inflammation  in the lower spine or hips can cause pain in the lower back, which may also radiate into the legs.  The  most common  forms of arthritis include:  Arthritis symptoms can vary greatly, but they typically include red, swollen joints and reduced mobility. Symptoms may also come and go in cycles or get worse over time.  The treatment plan will depend on the type of arthritis and the severity of a person's symptoms, but it will often include a combination of lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and medication. For people with severe arthritis, a doctor may also sometimes recommend surgery.   Sciatica  is a sharp, burning or stabbing pain in the lower back that radiates through the buttocks and down into the back of the legs. A person may also experience a tingling sensation, numbness, or weakness in the legs.  The pain occurs when something places pressure on the sciatic nerve. Causes can include arthritis, back injuries and  fractures ,  herniated discs , and spinal compression.  Sciatica often gets better on its own, and a person may be able to treat it at home with rest, OTC pain relievers, and gentle stretching. If these treatments are ineffective, a doctor may recommend physical therapy, steroid injections, or surgery.  Infections of the spine or the surrounding tissues can lead to back pain and tenderness. If the infection irritates or damages the spinal nerves, this may cause pain or tingling sensations that radiate down to the legs.  Other symptoms of a spinal infection can include  fever , chills, and swelling, redness, or warmth in the affected area.  Spinal infections can occur if infections from other parts of the body spread to the spine. They can also occur as a complication of surgery, injuries to the back,  diabetes ,  cancer , and conditions that weaken the immune system.  The causative organism will determine the treatment, which may include  antibiotic  or antifungal medications. Other treatments can include surgical drainage or removal of infected tissue.   Ankylosing spondylitis  is a chronic condition in which the joints and vertebrae in the spine become inflamed, which causes back pain and stiffness. The condition can also spread to other parts of the body, including the ribs, hips, knees, and feet.  Other symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can include:  Doctors do not understand what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but people with certain genes are more likely to develop the condition.  There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, so doctors focus treatment on relieving a person's symptoms and preventing the condition from getting worse.  Treatment typically involves a combination of medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. A doctor may recommend surgery for people with severe joint damage.  A person can often treat back and leg pain at home with rest, OTC medications, and gentle exercise or stretching.  Consult a doctor if the pain:  People should seek immediate medical assistance if they also have symptoms such as:  Lower back and leg pain are often the result of minor injuries or poor posture, and the pain tends to get better with rest and home treatments. However, persistent or recurring pain may be a symptom of an underlying condition, such as arthritis or fibromyalgia.  People should see a doctor for pain that is severe, does not improve, or occurs along with other symptoms.  Some of the home remedies listed in this article are available for purchase online.
