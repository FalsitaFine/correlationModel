 It is a type of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). DMTs are an emerging class of drug that can help treat  multiple sclerosis  (MS), some types of  cancer , including  prostate cancer , and acute nonlymphocytic  leukemia .

  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require mitoxantrone to carry a black box warning about side effects.  These include:  The FDA also warn of a  higher risk  of developing secondary leukemia.  Mitoxantrone is an early form of DMT. For people with advanced-stage MS and severe symptoms, a doctor may prescribe mitoxantrone. However, newer medications are appearing that can replace its use in many cases.  Current  guidelines  recommend prescribing mitoxantrone for MS only if the benefits outweigh any possible risks.  A person who is using mitoxantrone for MS may wish to speak to their doctor about  new options  for treatment.  Doctors prescribe mitoxantrone to treat some types of cancer.  They may prescribe it:  Mitoxantrone can also reduce problems associated with MS when the MS is:  Mitoxantrone  is considered  an antineoplastic agent and a multiple sclerosis agent.  It works in different ways to treat MS and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and prostate cancer.  This drug can have a number of side effects, and some of them can be serious.  Anyone who is going to start using this drug should have a special visit with the clinician, who will discuss with them the risks and benefits of the drug, what they can expect, and what their preferences are.  According to  guidelines  published in 2018, there is evidence that mitoxantrone can lead to:  The guidelines note that clinicians should only prescribe mitoxantrone if the possible benefits greatly outweigh the possible risks. The guidelines add that other drugs are now available now with a lower risk to the individual.  Mitoxantrone may cause heart failure, which can be life-threatening. This can happen during therapy or months to years after therapy.   This drug can cause the white blood cell count to go down, indicating reduced immunity. This increases the chance of having an infection.  A doctor will not normally give this drug if a person's neutrophil count is less than 1,500, unless they have acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.  The platelet count may also go down, which increases the chance of bleeding.  Mitoxantrone may turn the urine blue-green for a few days after each dose.  It may also make the whites of the eyes a little blue, but this, too, will go away.  The most common side effects of mitoxantrone  include :  These are not usually serious, and a doctor can treat them.  If any of these symptoms occur, call a doctor right away.  If the symptoms may be life-threatening or if there may be a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.  Symptoms may include:  Symptoms may include:  Mitoxantrone does not cause drowsiness.  Some research  has suggested  that there is a higher risk of some types of leukemia when using this drug.  Patients using this medication for MS have developed  acute myelogenous leukemia  (AML), and those with cancer may have a higher risk of a secondary cancer if they take this drug.  Mitoxantrone can interact with other medications, herbs, or  vitamins .  It is important to tell the health provider about any existing medications, vitamins, or supplements currently in use, as they can interact and alter each other's effectiveness.  Some people should not use this drug.  These include:  Mitoxantrone can harm a developing baby, so the doctor may give a pregnancy test before each dose.  Studies  have linked DMTs with growth problems and a higher risk of preterm birth.  It is important not to become pregnant while taking mitoxantrone. Women should talk to their doctor about  birth control  before starting mitoxantrone.  Anyone who is pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant should inform their doctor as soon as possible.  Mitoxantrone is not suitable during breastfeeding, as it may be passed to the baby through the breast milk. This can be harmful to the baby.  The chemicals can remain in breast milk for up to a month after discontinuing the medication.  Allergic reactions have also been reported in some people. Symptoms include low  blood pressure ,  hives  and rashes, and difficulty breathing. In rare cases,  anaphylaxis  may occur.  Mitoxantrone can cause serious health problems if a healthcare provider does not administer it correctly. Only a doctor with experience of giving this kind of medication should administer mitoxantrone.  The doctor will determine a suitable dose, based on the individual's needs. It is important to take this medication exactly as prescribed by the doctor.  How long the treatment takes will depend on the condition.  A person's general health may affect their dose. It is essential to tell the doctor about any existing health conditions before receiving this drug.  If you miss an appointment for a dose, it is important to call the doctor's office to make another appointment as soon as possible.  This is a long-term treatment, and it may take time for the benefits to appear.  If the drug is working for MS, symptoms will not get worse, and there will be fewer flare-ups.  The doctor will do tests to see how well the drug is working for your cancer treatment.  A person should not stop using this drug without medical advice.  Anyone who is using mitoxantrone as a treatment for stable RRMS should receive counseling from a health professional about the need for ongoing follow-up.  A person with secondary progressive MS should undergo an assessment to see how likely they are to have a relapse in the future.  If mitoxantrone is not working, or if the adverse effects are significant, a doctor may prescribe a different DMT for a person with MS. There are now 17 different drugs available.  The doctor may perform these tests to monitor the individual's progress and health as they take mitoxantrone:   Travel : Mitoxantrone is only given by a healthcare provider, so anyone who is planning to travel should discuss their travel plans with their provider. In this way, they can arrange for a place to receive mitoxantrone while travelling.   Insurance : Many insurance companies will need prior authorization before they approve the payment for mitoxantrone.   Article last updated by Yvette Brazier on Tue 15 January 2019.
