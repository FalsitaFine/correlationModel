 Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of more than  120 substances  in cannabis. CBD comes from the cannabis plant, and it is a different compound than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which produces a high. CBD has no mind altering effects.  Some claim that cannabis reduces the symptoms of some types of  headache . There is little evidence that CBD oil is effective as a treatment option for  migraines .  Still, for people who have yet to find an effective migraine treatment, it may be worth considering.  Anyone who wishes to use CBD should speak with a doctor before obtaining or using it. They should also check that the product comes from a reputable source to ensure safety.  People used cannabis for thousands of years to treat headaches before it became illegal.  There is a lack of scientific evidence about its safety and effectiveness for this purpose, but researchers have suggested that one or more substances present in cannabis may have therapeutic benefit for headaches, including migraines.  It is important to remember that many of the studies may use the entire marijuana plant, and its effects are different than CBD oil.  There is evidence that CBD oil can reduce  inflammation  and pain in  arthritis . It may work similarly with migraines.  In a  review of studies , published in 2017, researchers saw a useful and effective role for marijuana in treating migraine, but there are not enough studies on using CBD oil specifically yet.  As the studies come in examining the effectiveness and side effects of CBD oil, there will be further changes in laws and recommendations.  Both the causes of migraines and the possible effects of CBD remain unclear. More studies specific to the components of marijuana, such as CBD, are necessary.  CBD oil may be an option for pain relief.  Authors of a study from 2012 suggest that CBD oil can help to relieve some types of chronic pain. However, the study did not relate specifically to headaches or migraines.  Results of a  2016 study  indicate that medical marijuana may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches. This research was not specific to CBD oil. More research is needed to determine what dosage and formulation are most effective.  Authors of a  2009 study  found evidence to suggest that cannabis compounds may treat chronic pain in people who have been taking opioids for long periods and want to reduce use.  In July 2018, an Australian  study  did not find a link between the use of cannabis and a reduction in pain or a lower use of opioids.  However, the results depended on participants reporting their own use of cannabis, and most of this was illegal use. It also focused on the effects of cannabis as a whole, rather than CBD or another specific cannabinoid.  The current laws regarding CBD are hazy. Hemp and hemp-derived products with a THC content of less than  0.3%  are legal under the Farm Bill.  However, some confusion remains around the specific details.  Check your  state laws  and those of any destination to which you may be traveling. The FDA have not yet approved any nonprescription products.  A purified CBD oil that contains no THC  received approval  by the FDA in June 2018 to treat two rare and severe types of  epilepsy . However, it requires a prescription.  Most products available do not have approval, which means the user cannot always be sure the product is safe.  Talk to a doctor about CBD and whether it is safe and legal to use.  The ways of using CBD include:  No studies involving humans have investigated the effects of CBD oil on migraines, so there is no standard dosage or method.  However, a doctor in an area where CBD oil is legal may be able to recommend a safe, low dosage to start with. The best recommendation is to start on a very low dose and see if it is effective.  One of the most significant risks concerns the lack of regulation.  Cannabis products and CBD do not have FDA approval for the treatment of migraine. As a result, there is no control over the potency of CBD oil before marketing and sale in the U.S. for most uses.  A  2017 research letter  published in JAMA noted that CBD products sometimes have incorrect labeling. Some contain more CBD than stated, others contain less, and some contain significant amounts of the psychoactive substance, THC.  For most health conditions, including migraine, a health provider is likely to recommend other proven treatments before CBD oil.  Identifying and avoiding migraine triggers can reduce the frequency of migraines. Strategies could include:  No treatment works for everyone, but some medications can reduce the frequency of migraines and diminish the intensity once they start.  Approved migraine treatments include:  Many people try a few treatments before finding one that works. Effective treatment might involve a combination of approaches.  Working closely with a health provider and keeping track of the frequency and intensity of migraines can help a person to discover the best treatment.  Anyone who experiences migraines should speak with a doctor, who will be able to suggest treatment options.  Individuals should consult a doctor before trying CBD oil or any natural supplements or therapies.  Some herbal medications, including cannabis and CBD oil, can have dangerous interactions with other medicines.  I have seen websites that talk about choosing different kinds of cannabis to treat a headache. What would you recommend?   There is some research on marijuana and migraines, but not enough to specifically recommend potency, dosage, or frequency. 
 Someone with chronic migraines who wants to reduce reliance on medication might choose marijuana products, such as CBD oil. 
 Because there are no specific studies, then recommendations found on websites like this are not based on science. These statements might be the personal experience of only one person, or someone might have created them from nothing as a marketing ploy. 
 Regardless, there is no way to test the truth of those statements.   There is some research on marijuana and migraines, but not enough to specifically recommend potency, dosage, or frequency.
