 Vegetarians and vegans must take particular care to consume enough  vitamin  B-12, as it is mainly found in meat, eggs, and dairy products. Therefore, it is more likely a vegan or vegetarian will develop a vitamin B-12 deficiency.  In this article, we look at how much vitamin B-12 is required and list good vegetarian and vegan sources.  Ensuring a person includes enough vitamin B-12 in their diet is essential for optimum health. The health benefits of the vitamin include:  The  recommended daily allowance (RDA)  of B-12 depends on a person's age:  Infants between 7 and 12 months old require 0.5 mcg of B-12 per day, and babies less than 6 months old only need 0.4 mcg per day.  Pregnant women require 2.6 mcg, while breast-feeding women need 2.8 mcg per day.  For vegetarians looking to increase their  vitamin B12  intake, there are a variety of options. Some good choices for B-12 include:  While seaweed, algae, and certain mushrooms all contain vitamin B-12, they are not reliable sources because they do not act the same way in the human body.  Studies have found  that consuming these foods does not significantly increase a person's vitamin B-12 levels and can still lead to a deficiency.  A vegetarian should be sure to consume enough of the following foods on a regular basis. It is vital to understand how much vitamin B-12 these foods contain:  Fortified cereals are a good choice as they have high bioavailability. This means that the vitamin B-12 does not have to break down before the body absorbs it.  Nutritional yeast is popular with both vegetarians and vegans because it is easy to add to dishes while cooking and has a rich, cheesy, nutty flavor. Nutritional yeast can be added to cooked meals or sprinkled on food and snacks. It is available to  buy online .  To use nutritional yeast, a person can:  Because vegans avoid all animal-derived products, they may rely on vitamin B-12 fortified foods, such as certain breakfast cereals and nutritional yeast. Plant foods do not produce vitamin B-12, so it is vital that vegans find alternative sources of vitamin B12 to remain in the best health.  Some foods that can be fortified with vitamin B-12 include:  It is essential to read the labels on all of these foods, as some may not be fortified with vitamin B-12. For those who are already B-12 deficient, supplemental B-12 in the form of capsules or injections may be required. B-12 supplements are available to  buy online .  A vitamin B-12 deficiency can have severe consequences for a person's health. Common problems associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency include  anemia , certain neurological disorders, and reduced growth and healing.  Common symptoms of a vitamin B-12 deficiency include:  A person who experiences these symptoms should make an appointment with their doctor. The doctor will ask about their symptoms and perform tests to determine whether a lack of vitamin B-12 is the cause.  Vegetarians and vegans should take steps to ensure they include an adequate amount of vitamin B-12 in their diet. Health professionals can provide advice on where to find sources of vitamin B-12 and how much they need to take.  Without maintaining proper levels of vitamin B-12, a person can suffer serious side effects, including nerve damage and depression.  Since no plant-derived foods contain vitamin B-12, vegans and vegetarians should be aware of alternative sources, such as fortified products.
