 Swelling or  inflammation  is part of the body's natural response to injury.  Edema  refers to swelling due to trapped fluid, and it can happen anywhere in the body. If edema occurs in the brain, however, it can cause severe complications.  Cerebral edema can restrict the supply of blood to the brain. Blood carries oxygen to the brain, which the brain requires to function. A lack of oxygen in the brain can damage brain cells or cause them to die.  Intracranial pressure (ICP) can affect specific regions of the brain or the whole brain depending on the underlying cause.  Cerebral edema can cause irreversible damage and, in some cases, be fatal.  Symptoms of cerebral edema may include:  The symptoms will vary depending on the severity and underlying cause of the swelling.  The ICP associated with cerebral edema can have a range of different causes, including:  Diagnosing cerebral edema can be challenging, as there are many potential causes and the symptoms may vary considerably.  To make a diagnosis, a doctor may do:  Cerebral edemas require immediate medical attention to reduce the risk of permanent damage or death.  Treatments will vary depending on the severity and underlying cause of ICP, but may include:  Cerebral edemas can have severe and irreversible consequences. The outlook can vary considerably, depending on the precise location and severity of the edema, as well as how quickly a person receives treatment.  It is crucial for doctors to provide immediate and appropriate medical attention to minimize the risk of complications.
