 Environmental changes in the body, certain health issues, and the use of  antibiotics  can encourage the growth of  Candida . If there is an overgrowth of  Candida , it can cause an infection called  candidiasis .  In this article, we discuss the signs and symptoms of  Candida  in stools and elsewhere in the body, as well as how to treat it.  Although the presence of  Candida  in stools can indicate an overgrowth, this is not always the case.  In fact, researchers have found  Candida  in around  65%  of stools from healthy adults.  Most people might not know they have  Candida  in their stools until they become aware of the following :   If people have a  Candida  overgrowth, they may also experience the following symptoms:  Other symptoms of a  Candida  overgrowth depend on where the yeast is in the body. In the sections below, we look at symptoms that may develop when  Candidaoccurs  in different locations within the body :   Symptoms include:  Symptoms include:  Symptoms include:  Sometimes,  Candida  can spread to infect the blood. This is known as deep, or invasive, candidiasis, and it can be life threatening.  Invasive candidiasis can cause shock and organ failure. If a person who is receiving antibacterial treatment for a  Candida  infection has  fever  and chills that do not go away, they should seek immediate medical attention.  Medication use, certain health conditions, and lifestyle factors can all cause the balance of microbes and moisture levels in the body to change.  These changes can encourage the  Candida  yeast to grow and cause an infection.  In the sections below, we look at some possible causes in more detail:  Healthful bacteria help keep  Candida  in check.  Antibiotics kill good bacteria as well as bad bacteria, which can affect the balance of microbes in the body. This can cause an overgrowth of  Candida .   Some research  found that people with gastrointestinal issues had high levels of  Candida  in their stool. These conditions included:  Many researchers believe that the  inflammation  these conditions cause and develop from promotes  Candida  growth, which then results in further inflammation.  People with health conditions that weaken the immune system — such as  HIV ,  AIDS , and some  cancers  — may be more at risk of experiencing  Candida  overgrowth.  This is because the body is less able to fight off infections.   Diabetes  can increase the risk of a  Candida  overgrowth because high blood sugar levels encourage the yeast to grow.

One  study from 2010  found that exposing healthy rats to stress led to increased levels of  Candida  on the rats' tongues.  Smoking can also increase the risk of a  Candida  overgrowth, especially in the form of  oral thrush .  One  study from 2006  found that in participants who smoked, 58% had  Candida  present in their stools, while only 29% of nonsmokers had  Candida  present.  As well as reducing the risk of  Candida  overgrowth,  quitting smoking  has many other health benefits.  Learn more here .  Other  risk factors  for  Candida  overgrowth include the use of:  A doctor will take a stool sample to determine if there is a  Candida  overgrowth present.  Many healthy people have  Candida  in their stools, so a doctor may also carry out other tests to check for an overgrowth.  They will carry out a physical examination and take a medical history to determine if antibiotic use could be causing the  Candida  overgrowth.  If  Candida  is affecting a specific area of the body, the doctor may take a skin sample from the area.  A doctor may prescribe antifungal medication to treat the  Candida  overgrowth and return the fungi to normal levels.  Potential side effects of antifungal drugs may include feeling nauseous, vomiting, and diarrhea.   Common  antifungal medication for  Candida  infections include:  People can take antifungal medications orally to treat  Candida  infections in the mouth and esophagus.  Topical antifungal creams can treat  Candida  infections on the skin.  For vaginal  Candida  infections, antifungal medication is available as a cream, tablet, or suppository.  People with an invasive  Candida  infection will require intravenous antifungal medication.   Probiotics may  also work to treat an overgrowth. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help restore good bacteria in the body and restrict the growth of  Candida .  People may be able to prevent a  Candida  overgrowth by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. For example, a person can strive to:  People may notice an overgrowth of  Candida  if they find white mucus, foam, or a string-like substance in their stools.  Other symptoms of a  Candida  overgrowth depend on where the infection occurs in the body.  A  Candida  overgrowth is usually easily treatable, and with the correct treatment, it will have no long lasting health effects.  Otherwise healthy people may be able to treat a  Candida  overgrowth with a single dose of an antifungal medication.   Candida  infections may take longer to treat and may reoccur in people who:  If a  Candida  infection spreads to the blood, early diagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent the infection from spreading to major organs.  A doctor will prescribe antifungal medication, or potentially probiotics, to treat an overgrowth of  Candida .
