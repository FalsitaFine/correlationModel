  High blood pressure  affects around  77.9 million , or 1 in 3, adults in the United States, and 18.5 percent of them are unaware that they have the condition. It is normal for  blood pressure  to rise and fall throughout the day, but if it remains high for an extended period, it can cause heart problems and other health-related issues.  High blood pressure can put an excessive amount of pressure on artery walls, which can damage the body's blood vessels and organs. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to  heart attack  or  stroke ,  aneurysm ,  heart failure , weakened blood vessels in the kidneys, vision loss, and reduced thinking ability.  Making lifestyle changes can go a long way toward helping to control your blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend regular exercise, following a healthful diet, maintaining a healthy weight, managing  stress , and  quitting smoking . Sometimes, though, changing your lifestyle is not enough and your doctor may recommend medication.  Only  half  of all people with high blood pressure have it under control.
