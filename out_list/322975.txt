 When the immune system attacks itself, the result is  inflammation  in a joint that can cause pain, stiffness, and mobility problems.  There are over  100 types of arthritis , and different types cause different symptoms.  Rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and psoriatic  arthritis  are among the most common types of autoimmune arthritis.  This article will take a close look at autoimmune arthritis, identify common symptoms, and outline some of the most common treatments currently available to combat arthritis-related joint inflammation.  While this list is by no means comprehensive, it represents some of the most common forms of autoimmune arthritis:  Each of these conditions can cause a great deal of discomfort and swelling in the joints.  While the symptoms of autoimmune arthritis vary depending on the specific underlying arthritis type, some general symptoms associated with autoimmune arthritis include:  The specific symptoms vary between types of autoimmune arthritis.  For example, psoriatic arthritis can cause a condition called enthesitis, which causes tender spots on areas where ligaments and tendons connect to bones. These often occur in the back of the heel and around the elbow.  Risk factors for autoimmune arthritis depend upon the type of arthritis that a person has. However, genetics and a family history of a specific condition can affect a person's likelihood of developing autoimmune arthritis.  However, environmental factors may also be responsible. Because autoimmune arthritis causes the immune system to attack itself, doctors have tried to identify what environmental factors might contribute to this:  Possible environmental factors that could contribute to autoimmune arthritis include:  A person's sex may affect their risk level depending on arthritis type. For example, women are  two to three times more likely  to get RA than men. However, men get ankylosing spondyloarthritis  more often  than women.  Specialist doctors called rheumatologists treat autoimmune arthritis.  Rheumatologists study the immune system and are aware of all the available treatments. If a doctor suspects that a person has a type of autoimmune arthritis, they will usually refer them to a rheumatologist.  A doctor will first ask a person about their symptoms, including what makes their symptoms worse and what, if anything, makes them better. They may ask about other medical conditions a person has, as well as what medicines they are taking.  A doctor will likely recommend a range of tests to learn more about a person's health and find out which joints are affected.  Examples of diagnostic tests for autoimmune arthritis may include:  However, no single test can definitively diagnose an autoimmune arthritis type. Often, diagnosis involves a person undergoing a range of tests to rule out other conditions and other types of arthritis.  Doctors will consider a person's symptoms, the type of arthritis they have, and their overall health when recommending a treatment plan for autoimmune arthritis.  Some people with mild forms of autoimmune arthritis can benefit from taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. These include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).  For other types of arthritis, a doctor may prescribe medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  Examples of DMARDs include:  If DMARDs are not effective in treating autoimmune arthritis, a doctor may prescribe biologic response modifiers or "biologic agents." These medications block immune system communications that can lead to the symptoms of autoimmune arthritis.  Examples of biologic agents  include :  Sometimes a person may take these medications in combination with DMARDs, especially methotrexate.  Medications can have side effects that cause complications on their own. DMARDs and biologics, for instance, are immunosuppressants that can leave people susceptible to infections.  In addition to medical treatments for autoimmune arthritis, a doctor will likely recommend lifestyle changes and choices that can benefit a person with an autoimmune disorder.  Examples of lifestyle changes to manage autoimmune forms of arthritis include:  A person who has autoimmune arthritis should also talk to their doctor about other steps they can take to improve their overall health.  The long-term effects of autoimmune arthritis can depend on the type a person has.  For example, RA can cause joint deformities that make it difficult for a person to use their hands and feet. People with RA are also at greater risk of developing  heart disease  and  diabetes .  A person with any type of autoimmune arthritis who experiences frequent bouts of pain and swelling may also have difficulty keeping to a regular schedule of work and socializing.  Sometimes, people with RA may experience such severe joint complications that they require surgery. There is a variety of surgical options available, including spinal fusion for  ankylosing spondylitis  or a hip replacement for other arthritis types.  Identifying and treating autoimmune arthritis as quickly as possible helps to minimize any complications.  Autoimmune arthritis can have significant effects on a person's life. However, many treatments are available that can help a person with autoimmune arthritis live a healthier, happier life.  People should talk to their doctor about the best approaches for treating autoimmune arthritis, as well as healthful lifestyle changes they can make.
