 A scab is a collection of material, such as blood and skin cells, that forms a protective layer over damaged skin. They form to protect injured skin from bacteria and infections.  This article will describe how to tell if a wound has become infected, the best home remedies and medical treatments, and when to see a doctor.  A scab is the body's way of protecting a wound against invading organisms, dirt, and debris. If a scab cracks, dislodges, or otherwise fails to keep bacteria out, they can enter the wound and cause a skin infection.  The term "infected scab" is misleading. The scab itself is made of dead cells and cannot become infected. It is the wound itself that becomes infected.  People may be able to tell when a wound underneath a scab is infected by how the scab looks, as well as the presence of some other symptoms.   Symptoms  that the wound under a scab is infected include the following:  If the scab appears to be getting bigger after several days instead of staying the same size or getting smaller, this can also indicate an infection.  A common misconception is that if a scab is black instead of deep red or brown, the area is infected. This is not the case.  If a person suspects that they have an infected wound underneath a scab, the first stage of treatment is to make sure that the wound is clean and dry.   Current guidelines  suggest that the best ways to keep a wound clean are as follows:  There are just as many wound treatment "don'ts" as there are "dos." Examples of what not to do include the following:  As well as practicing proper cleansing techniques, people can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce wound pain and swelling. However, people should always consult a doctor before starting any new medications.  If a wound starts to show signs of infection, a doctor may recommend the following treatments:  Doctors can approach wound healing techniques in a variety of ways depending on the wound's location, a person's overall health, and the organism causing the infection. A doctor should provide specific post-care instructions as to how to treat the wound moving forward.  People should see a doctor if they experience any of the following symptoms related to a scab:  If the scab seems to be increasing in size instead of decreasing, a person should see their doctor. If the wound is large, worsening, severely infected, causing fever or other symptoms, or affecting circulation, a person should seek immediate medical attention.  People can often prevent infections by keeping an open wound clean and dry. Refraining from disrupting the scab until it falls off on its own can also help.  The area around a scab can become itchy or feel tight after a few days, but try to refrain from itching the scab, no matter how tempting it may be. Scratching a scab can dislodge or crack it, increasing the risk of bacteria entering the wound.  Scabs are the body's natural mechanism for protecting wounds and preventing bacteria from entering the skin.  If a scab does not fully protect the wound, people can develop skin infections below the scab. Symptoms of an infection include yellow pus draining from the wound, heat, redness, and swelling around the injury site.  For a suspected infection, use simple cleaning methods and talk to a doctor about the best course of treatment if concerned.  To prevent infections, people should keep the wound clean and dry and avoid cracking or removing scabs as the wound heals.
