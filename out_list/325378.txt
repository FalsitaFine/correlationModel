  Acupuncture  is the ancient practice of inserting thin needles into the skin. People have used it as a complementary treatment for thousands of years.  Some studies have suggested that acupuncture can help with pain relief,  stress  management, immune system response, and  inflammation . However, researchers need to conduct more large-scale, double-blind studies before they can prove this.  Scientists have also studied the effects of acupuncture in  psoriasis  and  psoriatic arthritis  (PsA).  Although they have not yet confirmed its alleged benefits, receiving acupuncture from a licensed and qualified provider has very few risks, so it may be worth a try for people who have psoriasis or PsA.  In this article, we review the evidence around acupuncture for psoriasis, what the procedure involves, and possible risks.  Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes red or purple scaly patches on the skin that may peel, itch, and bleed.  PsA, which affects some people who have psoriasis, can cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.  Traditional treatments for these conditions include:  Acupuncture could also be a helpful treatment for psoriasis. Some research has suggested that acupuncture may be worth considering:  Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, is a trigger for psoriasis flares. However, acupuncture needles are very thin, sterile, and single-use, so they should cause little to no injury to the skin.  Although evidence for acupuncture as a treatment for PsA specifically is lacking, many studies have shown that acupuncture works well in relieving other types of joint pain:  Both psoriasis and PsA can cause stress and  anxiety  due to pain, itching, swelling, the skin's appearance, and other factors.  Acupuncture may be one way to help treat that anxiety and improve quality of life for people with psoriasis and PsA.  Evidence suggests that acupuncture can help with anxiety symptoms, which could be beneficial for people with psoriasis and PsA:  Although these studies do not prove that acupuncture can help with psoriasis or PsA-related anxiety specifically, the anxiety-relieving effects of acupuncture could be helpful for people living with these conditions.  Acupuncture is a  traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)  practice that involves placing tiny needles in the skin.  The needles stimulate acupuncture points on the body. They are thinner than those that doctors use to draw blood or give injections, as they only enter the surface of the skin.  Acupuncturists generally believe that stimulating certain points of the body helps its energy, or qi, flow freely. in turn, this can help treat or prevent certain health conditions.  During an acupuncture appointment, a person may need to remove some of their clothing so that the acupuncturist can access certain parts of the body, such as the abdomen, ankles, neck, back, or wrists.  Usually, the person will lie down on a bed and use a sheet or blanket to cover up and keep warm.  The acupuncturist may use an alcohol wipe to clean the areas that they intend to stimulate. Then, they lightly tap the needles into the specified points on the body. In some cases, the acupuncturist may use heat or electrical stimulation on the needles to enhance their effect.  At this point, the acupuncturist may leave the person alone to rest while the needles stay on the skin. Some practitioners use soft music, heat lamps, or other comfort measures during this time.  After several minutes, the practitioner will return to the room, remove the needles, and dispose of them in a sharps container.  Acupuncture may not be a quick fix, however. It may require several visits before a person sees results.  For example,  one case report  found that a woman underwent acupuncture once per week for 13 weeks and only then experienced an improvement in her psoriasis symptoms.   Another case report  had a similar outcome, with people reporting improvements in their psoriasis symptoms after 14 weeks of the treatment.  When a person receives acupuncture from a licensed provider, the risks are very low, according to the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health .  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate acupuncture needles as medical devices. This means that only licensed providers should use them, always ensuring that they are sterile, nontoxic, and have only one use before disposal.  However, if a person receives acupuncture from an unlicensed or nonqualified provider, or if the needles are not sterile and single-use, there are risks of infection, injury, and serious effects such as punctured organs.  Before receiving acupuncture, check that the provider is licensed or certified and is educated in TCM and acupuncture. The  National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine  list board-certified acupuncture providers on their website.  People who have psoriasis or PsA may find that an alternative treatment such as acupuncture can help them keep their condition under control.  Acupuncture can also help relieve stress, which could help prevent some psoriasis flares.  People who have psoriasis and PsA should still see a medical practitioner regularly. This can help ensure that their condition remains under control.  They should also tell their healthcare provider about acupuncture and any other complementary treatments they are trying.
