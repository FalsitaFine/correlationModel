 The most significant cause of bone pain is  bone cancer . This disease is most likely to occur in the long bones of the upper arms or legs, but it may affect any bone. When  cancer  cells originate in the bone itself, this is called primary bone cancer.  Pain caused by bone cancer may have the following symptoms:  It would be wise to see a doctor if symptoms include:  People should also see a doctor if they experience swelling or redness on or around a painful bone, or if they have  bone fractures  after minor injuries.  There are many other possible causes of bone pain, which include:  In addition to bone pain, the possible symptoms of bone cancer are:  Less common symptoms may also include:  Treatment aims to relieve pain, mend any fractures, and prevent or delay further bone complications.  There are different treatment approaches for bone cancer depending on its type and how far it has spread in the body.  These include:  Treatment for non-cancerous bone pain depends largely on the cause of the pain.  A doctor's diagnosis will determine the treatment, which may consist of:  The outlook for bone cancer might be different depending on:  Primary bone cancer is rare. According to the  American Cancer Society , about 3,500 people will receive a diagnosis of primary bone cancer in 2019, accounting for 0.2 percent of all cancers.  If a person's cancer has not spread and they are otherwise in good health, treatment will be more straightforward, and their outlook will be better.  According to  statistics , about 75 percent of people diagnosed with primary bone cancer live for 1 year or more, while over 50 percent live for 5 years or longer.
