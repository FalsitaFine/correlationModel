 According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , gestational  diabetes  develops in approximately 2–10% of pregnancies in the United States each year.  Gestational diabetes can negatively affect both the woman and fetus. Possible effects include:  Keep reading for tips on how to help prevent gestational diabetes. We also cover risk factors and early signs and symptoms.  Although gestational diabetes is not always avoidable, women can take some steps to help reduce their chances of developing it.  A woman looking to conceive should make lifestyle choices that can help her reach and maintain a healthy weight ahead of getting pregnant.  The authors of a  2018 study  looked at 10 years of data on gestational diabetes and concluded that being overweight was a significant risk factor.  Other  research  confirms that having a  BMI  higher than 25 increases a woman's likelihood of developing gestational diabetes. However, the researchers also noted that making dietary changes reduced the risk.  People looking to lose weight can take steps to modify their diet, such as:  Exercise is a vital part of maintaining a healthy weight. Both before and during pregnancy, exercise can help prevent gestational diabetes. Exercise helps the body become more sensitive to the  insulin  that the pancreas creates, which helps regulate blood sugar levels.  It is a good idea to start getting active before becoming pregnant, even if it means making simple, long-term lifestyle changes. For anyone with a sedentary lifestyle, steps that may help include:  Anyone looking to prevent gestational diabetes should try to do about 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on 4–5 days of the week. Moderate-intensity exercise should cause a person to break a sweat.  Good cardio options include stationary biking, walking, swimming, and using an elliptical machine.  However, pregnant women should speak to a doctor about any new exercise regimens and discuss which types are safe to do at each stage of pregnancy.  During pregnancy,  morning sickness , cravings, and food aversions can make it challenging to eat a nutritious diet.  However, eating well can help prevent gestational diabetes and ensure that a woman only gains a healthy amount of weight during each trimester.  Healthful food choices include:  It is best to avoid:  A woman should see a  gynecologist  regularly during pregnancy for routine care. During these visits, the doctor will ask about the pregnancy and any new symptoms.  They will also do a pelvic exam and use an  ultrasound  to look at the developing fetus. A doctor may recognize some of the early signs of gestational diabetes and suggest ways to help prevent it.  Between 24 and 28 weeks, a pregnant woman will have a gestational diabetes screening. If the results come back positive for gestational diabetes, the doctor will talk to her about how to prevent further complications.  There are several primary risk factors for developing gestational diabetes,  including :  Many women with gestational diabetes do not experience significant symptoms. The symptoms may also be difficult to distinguish from those that occur due to regular changes during pregnancy.  Possible early signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes include:  It is usually possible to discuss gestational diabetes at a regular scheduled appointment during pregnancy.  However, anyone who experiences changes in symptoms or other complications should speak to a doctor or another healthcare professional as soon as possible.  A doctor can ask the individual about their symptoms and determine whether further tests are necessary.  It is not always possible to prevent gestational diabetes. Certain risk factors make it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy.  However, maintaining a healthy weight before and after conception, eating well, and exercising regularly during pregnancy can all reduce the risk.  Anyone worried that they might have gestational diabetes or a higher risk of it should discuss this with a doctor at their next pregnancy checkup.
