 However, other simple methods of burning fat place less demand on a person's time. For example, maintaining a healthy sleep pattern and reducing  stress  are good ways to help the body burn fat. Adopting these habits over time can make it easier to maintain a calorie deficit, which should lead to fat loss.  In this article, we discuss some of the best ways for people with a busy schedule to burn fat.  Protein is an essential nutrient that supports cell functioning and helps build and maintain bones, muscles, and skin. It is also useful for people looking to burn fat.  Research consistently  shows  that protein is the most effective nutrient group for satiety, which means that it can help make a person feel full.  Incorporating high-protein foods into meals may mean that people need smaller portion sizes to feel full, and it might help people avoid snacking between meals.  In these ways, protein can reduce the total number of  calories  that a person consumes throughout the day.  Foods that are high in protein include:  Physical activity is crucial for weight loss, and it does not have to include structured exercise, such as going for a run, playing a sport, or working out at the gym.  The  American College of Sports Medicine  recommend at least 250 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity for significant weight loss. Examples of moderate-intensity physical activity  include :  Doing more of these activities throughout the week will help burn fat. People can try walking to work instead of using public transport or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, for example.  Sleep is important for many aspects of health, including fat loss.  The  National Sleep Foundation  recommend that adults aim for between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that  35.2%  percent of adults across the United States are getting less than 7 hours of sleep each night.  Research  suggests  that short sleep duration can lead to weight gain, particularly in younger people. One  study  found that adults who had insufficient sleep for 5 consecutive days ate more in the evenings than those who had adequate sleep. This snacking caused an energy imbalance that led to weight gain.  Aiming for 7 to 9 hours of good quality sleep could help promote fat burn and prevent weight gain.  Stress harms the body and increases the risk of several chronic health conditions.  Research has  found  that chronic stress can also lead to weight gain and  obesity . The results of a recent  study  in mice suggest that this could be due to stress-related abnormal glucocorticoid levels.  Reducing stress may be another useful way to burn fat. Some examples of methods for reducing stress  include :  It is best to avoid sugar in general to burn fat, but sugary drinks may be a particular problem.  Sugary drinks are high in calories. For example, one bottle of Coca-Cola contains  240 calories . Unlike many other sources of calories, most sugary drinks contain little to no nutritional value. They also do not satisfy hunger and are a poor source of energy. As a result, people may be more likely to consume them regularly.  The authors of a  review  of 32 studies looking at the link between sugary beverages and  body weight  concluded that consuming these drinks promotes weight gain in both adults and children.  Cutting down on sugary drinks will be helpful for burning fat. Swapping out these drinks for  green tea  may be particularly beneficial, as drinking  green tea  can potentially aid weight loss.  Intermittent fasting involves extended periods of not eating. There are many different forms of intermittent fasting, including the 5:2 diet, which requires a person to eat significantly fewer calories on 2 days of the week.  Although the research on intermittent fasting is still relatively new, the initial results are promising. One  review  of clinical trials found that intermittent fasting reduces body weight and appetite. The authors suggest that intermittent fasting could be as effective as traditional calorie restriction diets.  Some  research  has shown that people with obesity adjust to intermittent fasting in a couple of weeks and no longer feel very hungry when fasting. By managing hunger, intermittent fasting could be a weight loss tool that is sustainable in the long term.  Burning fat requires patience, and it can be frustrating. Fitting regular gym sessions into a busy schedule is not always possible for everyone.  However, a person can use other methods to help burn fat, such as avoiding sugary drinks and eating protein-rich meals.  Incorporating as many of these methods as possible into a daily routine will help most people lose body fat over time.
