 Prednisone can help balance hormones in people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough corticosteroids.  It is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and can help treat diseases that cause  inflammation , such as  lupus ,  multiple sclerosis , and  arthritis . Prednisone can also alter the function of the immune system.  Whether they are taking a short course of the medication or need to use it long-term, people often wonder if they can drink alcohol while taking prednisone.  This article will explore the side effects of prednisone and alcohol and whether they might be safe to use together.  There is no straightforward answer to whether it is safe to drink alcohol while taking prednisone. It depends on several factors, including:  In general, a person's doctor can best determine whether mixing prednisone with alcohol will be safe.  The main concern about using prednisone and alcohol is that alcohol can make the side effects of prednisone much worse.  Potential risks of using alcohol and prednisone together include:  Prednisone can increase the risk of gastrointestinal disturbance. Long-term use of alcohol causes inflammation of the stomach lining, which can lead to stomach ulcers,  heartburn , and  malnutrition .  People with existing stomach issues, such as heartburn, should avoid using prednisone and alcohol together.  Another side effect of prednisone is a weakened immune system, which can make people more vulnerable to infections.  The body may have more trouble fighting off diseases than it usually would. Exposure to  measles  or  chickenpox  can cause more severe infection in people taking steroids.  Alcohol also weakens the immune system. Chronic alcohol use can make it easier for people to become ill with  pneumonia or tuberculosis , for example. Anyone who takes prednisone and drinks alcohol regularly has a higher risk of developing an infection.  While multiple factors are involved, research suggests that alcohol intake can lead to  weight gain  in some people.  Weight gain  is also a possible side effect of prednisone.  Long-term prednisone use can make the bones weaker and more brittle, leading to  osteoporosis . Alcohol use is also a risk factor for osteoporosis, due to loss of nutrients. Having osteoporosis puts a person at risk of severe  bone fractures .  Alcohol can cause  blood sugar levels to drop , which can be problematic for a person with  diabetes . People with diabetes also need to be aware that alcohol can cause inflammation of the pancreas and lead to complications.  Prednisone can increase blood sugar levels. Anyone with diabetes who is taking prednisone may require more  insulin  or medication to lower their blood sugar.  There are several precautions to take while on prednisone:  Whether it is safe to drink alcohol while on prednisone depends on the dosage of the medication, the length of the course of treatment, and how frequently a person uses alcohol.  A person taking a short course of prednisone may want to avoid alcohol until they finish the treatment.  Alcohol can worsen some side effects of prednisone, such as immune system suppression, bone weakening, and weight gain. It is best to speak with a doctor to avoid serious complications.
