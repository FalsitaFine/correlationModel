 People come into contact with  very small amounts  of silver on a daily basis. It is present in food, drinking water, and even in the air that we breathe.  These trace amounts of silver are so small that the body can easily excrete them without experiencing any adverse effects.  However, prolonged exposure to small amounts of silver or a single exposure to a large dose can increase the risk of argyria.  The single characteristic symptom of argyria is blue or gray discoloration of the skin.  Skin discoloration or hyperpigmentation may also affect the mucous membranes, such as the:  The conjunctival membranes of the eyes may also appear discolored.  Silver particles may enter a person's body via the mouth or directly through the skin and mucous membranes.  Silver that enters the body via the mouth can cause generalized argyria. In generalized argyria, discoloration may affect the entire surface of the skin, as well as the mucous membranes and internal organs.  Silver that enters the body through the skin tends to cause localized argyria. With localized argyria, skin discoloration only affects the area that has come into contact with the silver particles.  Certain factors can affect the degree of skin discoloration.  These include :  Higher levels of silver cause more significant discoloration.  Melanin is a natural skin pigment that causes the skin to darken on exposure to sunlight.  In argyria, sun exposure causes silver particles in the skin to stimulate the release of excess melanin.  As a result, parts of the body that receive more sun exposure may become significantly darker. These areas typically include the face, neck, and arms.  In the early stages of argyria, the skin may turn a blue color. Over months or years, the affected area may darken to a slate gray.  Experts do not yet know the amount of silver that is sufficient to cause argyria.  However, people who have the  highest risk  of developing the condition are those with jobs or hobbies that involve prolonged exposure to silver. Examples include silver mining, photographic processing, jewelry-making, and soldering.  The following factors can also expose people to excessive amounts of silver:  A doctor may request blood, urine, and stool samples from a person with suspected argyria. These will help them determine whether a person has come into contact with silver in the last week.  To confirm a diagnosis of argyria, the doctor may also take a skin biopsy. This procedure involves the removal of a small piece of skin for analysis under the microscope. The appearance of  brown-black  granules within the sample indicates the presence of silver.  The doctor will also need to rule out  other conditions  that can cause blue-gray skin discoloration. These include:  There is currently no cure for argyria, but recent research indicates that laser therapy using the quality switch (QS) laser may significantly improve skin discoloration. The QS laser delivers high-intensity pulses of light to affected areas of skin.  In 2015, researchers conducted a  review of six studies  investigating the efficacy of QS laser therapy in treating argyria.  The researchers concluded that a single treatment with the QS laser could offer both immediate and long-term improvement in skin discoloration.  However, scientists will need to conduct further studies to confirm the efficacy of the QS laser in treating argyria.   Additional recommendations  for limiting further skin discoloration include:   Very few  people have died from overexposure to silver. In fact, people with argyria are unlikely to notice any negative health effects as a result of their condition.  However, they may experience psychological distress due to the changes in their skin color. Some may feel depressed, anxious, or socially withdrawn, especially if treatment fails to deliver the desired results.  People who are feeling depressed or anxious should tell their doctor, who may refer them to a registered counselor or therapist. Talking therapies can help people work through any psychological symptoms that may develop.  Argyria is mainly a cosmetic concern and does not negatively affect a person's physical health. For some people, however, changes in skin color may cause significant psychological distress.  Talking therapies can help people work through any  depression  or  anxiety  that they may feel as a result of the condition.  In terms of treatment for argyria, QS laser therapy appears to deliver significant, and sometimes complete, improvement in skin discoloration. However, scientists will need to conduct further studies to confirm this effect.  Is argyria contagious?  No, argyria is not contagious. Argyria is a condition that develops as a result of silver particles entering the skin or mucous membranes. These particles manifest as a bluish grey discoloration that is irreversible. Argyria occurs when you have too much exposure to silver through your occupation, medications, or dental fillings. The ingestion of dietary supplements with colloidal silver can also put you at risk for argyria. You cannot catch argyria from another person.
