 Everyone dreams but not everyone remembers doing so. People tend to spend about 2 hours each night dreaming. Sleep and dreams are complex and remain a mystery to scientists.  What we do know is that quality sleep is essential for many brain functions. Sleep affects how nerve cells communicate with each other. Researchers now also believe that sleeping can help remove toxins that build up in the brain during waking hours.  Sleep affects almost every type of tissue and system in the body, from the brain and heart to the immune system and mood.  A person may have vivid dreams for any number of reasons, depending on individual situations.  People often find that thoughts from the day invade their dreams. They usually experience the most vivid dreams during rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep, which we cover in more detail below.  Causes of vivid dreams include:   Sleep deprivation  can lead to more intense dreaming.  Alcohol consumption can suppress REM sleep. When a person stops drinking, it can lead to unusually vivid and intense dreams.  Using  certain substances  — such as marijuana, cocaine, and ketamine — can contribute to vivid or unpleasant dreams.  People who are recovering from  addiction  may find that they have vivid dreams about using the drug they are recovering from.  This is relatively common.

People with  narcolepsy  often say that they  have vivid dreams  that can be bizarre or disturbing.  Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that blurs the line between sleep and wakefulness. People with the condition feel very sleepy and fatigued during the day.  Symptoms include sleep attacks, wherein a person falls asleep and experiences a sudden loss of muscle control (cataplexy) during the day.  When someone has narcolepsy, they fall into REM sleep shortly after falling asleep. This can cause them to have vivid dreams even during a brief nap.  People with narcolepsy may also experience  lucid dreaming . In lucid dreaming, a person is aware that they are dreaming, and they may also be able to control the experience.  In cases such as pregnancy and short-term stress, vivid dreams will usually go away on their own.  However, there are a few ways that people can avoid having vivid dreams. These include avoiding substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and ketamine and reducing alcohol consumption.  Practicing good sleep hygiene can also help reduce the chance of having bad or vivid dreams.

Anyone who experiences distressing vivid dreams on a regular basis should talk to their doctor.
