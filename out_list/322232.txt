 In this article, we provide a color-coded guide to vaginal discharge. Learn what the colors mean and when to see a doctor.  Vaginal discharge is fluid secreted from tiny glands in the vagina and cervix. This fluid leaks from the vagina each day to remove old cells and debris, keeping the vagina and reproductive tract clean and healthy.  The amount of vaginal discharge can vary significantly from person to person. The color, consistency, and amount can also change from day to day, depending on where a person is in their menstrual cycle:  The shade of red can vary from bright to a dark rust color. Red discharge is most commonly the result of bleeding during a period.  Menstrual bleeding happens, on average, around every 28 days, though the normal range between 21 and 35 days. A period typically lasts for 3â€“5 days.  Anyone who experiences bleeding between menstrual periods should see a doctor.

Pink discharge most commonly occurs with spotting before a period. However, it can also be a sign of implantation bleeding in early pregnancy.  Some people experience a little bit of spotting after ovulation, which can also cause pink discharge.  Discharge can be pink after sexual intercourse if the sex has caused small tears or irritation in the vagina or cervix.  Most ordinary vaginal discharge is clear or whitish. It may be slippery or have the consistency of egg whites.  A person is likely to experience more clear, slippery discharge just before ovulation, during sexual arousal, and during pregnancy.
