 A doctor or nurse may  recommend a physical to :  In this article, we discuss what to expect during a routine physical exam. We also cover some specific types of physical exam.  Healthcare professionals typically carry out a physical exam in their office or in a dedicated room in a medical clinic or hospital.  It is important for the doctor or nurse to make sure that a person feels comfortable during a physical exam. The  American Medical Association  require clinics to provide a chaperone on request and to allow people to bring a friend or relative into the examination room with them.  Usually, the healthcare professional will also take a medical history before moving onto the physical exam. A medical history is a record of the person's current symptoms as well as any risk factors and previous medical issues that might be relevant.  The doctor or nurse may  ask about :  Exactly what the physical examination entails will depend on the reason for the test, but in general it can include:  For babies and young children, a physical exam may include:  Sometimes, people undergo physical examinations to check for a particular issue or health condition. In these cases, the healthcare professional may carry out specific tests in addition to or instead of those above. We discuss some of these specific tests below.  Doctors recommend regular skin exams to look for suspicious growths, moles, or other changes that may be a sign of  skin cancer . These exams are particularly important for people with risk factors for skin cancer, such as those with a family history of the condition.  A doctor may include a skin exam as part of a routine checkup. The exam will typically involve the doctor checking the person's skin  from head to toe .  A healthcare professional may recommend a clinical breast exam to check for abnormalities in and around the breast area.  During this exam, they will use the pads of their fingers to check the entire breast, including the underarm and collarbone area.  If they spot a lump, they will note its size, shape, and texture and check whether it moves easily. This is because lumps that are soft, smooth, round, and movable tend to be noncancerous  cysts .  The doctor will usually then recommend further diagnostic tests.  During a pelvic exam, a healthcare professional will examine the female reproductive organs to check for any gynecological problems. They may also perform a  Pap test  to check for signs of  cervical cancer .  Doctors usually recommend that females have their first pelvic exam when they  turn 21 years old  or if they experience any of the  following symptoms :  During the appointment, the doctor will usually ask the person about their periods and sexual activity. They will then ask the person to take off their underwear and lie on the table with their feet in stirrups and a sheet covering their stomach and legs.  The healthcare professional will visually inspect the area outside of the vagina before moving on to the speculum exam. A speculum is a small plastic or metal instrument. They will insert it into the vagina and then gently open it so that they can see the vaginal canal and cervix.  For the Pap test part of the examination, the doctor will use a plastic stick to collect a sample of cells from the inside of the cervix. They will then send this sample to a laboratory for analysis.   Learn more about Pap tests here .  Healthcare professionals commonly use a digital rectum exam to check for signs of  prostate cancer  in males. They may recommend the exam for people at higher risk of prostate cancer or those who experience any of the following symptoms:  A digital rectal exam only takes a few minutes. It is not usually painful, but it may be uncomfortable.  The doctor will ask the person to take off their pants and underwear before giving them a gown or cloth to wrap around themselves. The person will then either stand and bend forward at the waist or lie on their side in the fetal position on an exam table.  The healthcare professional will then gently insert a gloved and lubricated finger into the rectum to inspect the prostate for its size and the presence of any bumps, soft or hard spots, and other abnormalities. They will also examine the wall of the lower colon, or rectum.   Learn more about these types of test here .  Physical exams are a routine part of healthcare.
