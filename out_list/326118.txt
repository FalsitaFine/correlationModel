 Because the hands are in almost constant use, they are in regular contact with germs and other substances that can contribute to the development of pimple-like bumps and other skin conditions.  That said,  pimples  most commonly occur on the face, chest, and back. Pimple-like bumps affect the fingers, but pimples do not. A bump on the finger may be due to a  cyst , wart, or insect bite.  In this article, we explore the causes of a pimple-like bump on the finger. We also list several potential treatment options.  Myxoid pseudocysts, or digital  mucous cysts , are smooth, noncancerous bumps that develop on the fingers. They occur close to the nail, near the farthest finger joint.  In some cases, these cysts can cause a groove to form on the nail. This usually happens if the cyst affects the cells that produce a portion of the nail.  These pseudocysts are more common in people with  osteoarthritis (OA) , with some  research  suggesting that 64–93% of people with OA have myxoid cysts.  Myxoid cysts are round or oval. They may be firm or filled with fluid. They are not typically painful, although the joint near them may be painful as a result of  arthritis .  It is not necessary to treat a myxoid cyst unless it becomes bothersome. Often, the cyst regrows after treatment. Potential treatment options include:  There is no evidence to suggest that home remedies such as soaking or massaging are effective treatments for myxoid pseudocysts. Some options, such as draining the cyst at home, are not safe, as they increase the risk of infection.  Shaving or plucking hairs on the fingers can theoretically result in  ingrown hairs , but this is not known to happen on the fingers. This condition occurs when the hair later grows back at an angle, which causes it to grow into the skin.  Symptoms include:  Some cases of ingrown hairs can cause an infection in the hair follicle. This is called folliculitis.  Ingrown hairs do not usually require treatment. However, the following remedies may relieve any pain or itching:  Atopic dermatitis, or  eczema , can cause itchy, fine, red bumps on the fingers, hands, face, and other parts of the body.  This condition affects around  15–20%  of children and 1–3% of adults worldwide.  Eczema is usually a long term condition. Several factors, such as  stress  and weather, can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms.  Even though scratching the skin may provide relief in the short term, it can increase the risk of infection and worsen the eczema.  Medications and home remedies can treat eczema. Many people need a combination of both. Options include:  A wart is a small, noncancerous skin growth that is rare on the fingers or hands.  Warts  are  most common  among children and young adults.  These flesh colored bumps are usually easily distinguishable from other causes of bumps on the fingers, and they may also appear to have black dots in them.  Common warts develop as a result of a viral skin infection. They are typically harmless and often eventually clear up without treatment.  Some people treat their warts for cosmetic reasons, or if they become bothersome or painful.  Common warts typically resolve without treatment, though it may take a year or more.  Some potential treatment options include:  There is not much scientific evidence to suggest that home remedies for warts are effective. Anecdotal evidence, however, has indicated that regularly applying some of the following to the wart may be helpful:  A  ganglion cyst  is a noncancerous lump that forms on the joints of the fingers, hands, or wrists.  Ganglion cysts are round or oval and contain a jelly-like substance. Unlike pimples, ganglion cysts can be uncomfortable, especially if they press on a nerve. They may also affect the movement of the joint.  Ganglion cysts that do not cause problems do not require treatment. Research  suggests  that 58% of cysts will disappear over time without treatment.  No treatment is necessary for painless cysts. If people do wish to treat the cyst, however, their options include:   Fire ant bites  can cause a painful, red bump to form. This bump will then turn into a blister or a pimple. Almost everyone who receives a fire ant bite will develop a pimple containing yellow fluid  within 24 hours .  The pimples are very itchy, but they typically drain within 3 days. However, they may last for up to 1 week.  Other insect bites can cause similar symptoms to those of a fire ant bite.  Most insect bites will get better within a few minutes or hours, though it may take a week or more for the bump to completely disappear.  In the case of fire ant bites, the pain usually only lasts for a short period, although the itching may persist for several days.  To reduce pain and itching, people can try:  If the bite develops an infection,  antibiotics  may be necessary.  To reduce the risk of experiencing other skin issues, people can:  There are many moisturizing hand creams available to  buy online .  People should see their doctor if a pimple-like bump on the finger:  Pimples are much less likely to affect the fingers than other areas of the body. When pimple-like bumps occur on the finger, they may result from eczema, an insect bite, or another condition.  Home remedies are sometimes useful, but persistent or painful lumps on the finger may require further investigation and medical treatment.
