 Facial pain can originate from a specific area of the face, or it may radiate from another part of the head.  Doctors often categorize facial pain into one of several types, including:  In this article, we explore some common causes of facial pain. We also discuss when to see a doctor, diagnosis, and self-care.  There are many different types of  headache , a number of which can also cause facial pain. Some of these headaches include:  People who experience recurring headaches should consider seeing a doctor. Treatment varies depending on the type of headache but can include making suitable lifestyle changes and taking certain medications to prevent painful episodes and reduce symptoms.  Facial pain can often relate to current or past injuries, particularly those that damage the nerves in the face.  Examples of facial injuries can include cuts and blows from falls, impacts, violence, and accidents.  Rarely, surgery to the face, such as from cosmetic procedures, can cause nerve damage that leads to facial pain.  Symptoms of injuries to facial nerves can also include tingling, numbness, and even paralysis in or around the affected area.  The TMJ is where the jawbone, or mandible, connects to the skull. There are two TMJs, one on each side of the head.  "TMJ disorders" is the general term for conditions that cause pain and movement problems in the jaw joint and muscles.  According to the  National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , some estimates suggest that more than 10 million people in the United States have a TMJ disorder.  Symptoms of a TMJ disorder can  include :  A person may find that the pain is worse while chewing. The jaw might also feel tender at the joint, even when it is not moving.  Treatments for TMJ disorders depend on the severity of a person's symptoms, but they can include:   Trigeminal neuralgia , or tic douloureux, is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve in the face. This nerve has three main branches that provide sensations to the scalp, forehead, cheeks, lips, and lower jaw.  Trigeminal neuralgia usually affects only one side of the face, but some people can experience pain on both sides.  The pain tends to come on suddenly and can range in nature from a constant aching or burning sensation to a severe stabbing pain. Performing certain movements or actions, such as eating, brushing the teeth, and applying makeup, can trigger a painful episode, as can having the wind blow on the face.  These episodes may sometimes last for days or even weeks. They can become more frequent and more intense over time.  Causes of trigeminal neuralgia can include:  Treatments options for trigeminal neuralgia include:  A  dental abscess  is a buildup of  pus  that can develop when bacteria infect the soft tissue of a tooth.  These infections can occur when tooth decay or injuries that damage teeth allow bacteria to get inside the tooth.  Abscesses can cause a throbbing pain that may radiate to jaw, face, and neck. Other symptoms can include:  People who have symptoms of an abscess should see a healthcare professional as soon as they can. Abscesses can lead to more serious infections that spread to the jaw and other parts of the mouth.  Treatment options for an abscess depend on the cause and severity of the infection but can include:   Sinusitis  occurs when the sinuses become inflamed. The sinuses are the small cavities that sit behind the nose, cheekbones, and forehead.  Sinusitis usually starts following a cold, but nasal allergies such as  hay fever  can also cause the sinuses to become inflamed.  The  inflammation  inside the sinuses can cause blockages that lead to a buildup of mucus. Other symptoms of sinusitis can include:  Sinusitis often clears up on its own without treatment. However, people whose symptoms last for at least  12 weeks  may have chronic sinusitis.  Treatment options include taking OTC pain relievers, using steroid nasal sprays, and trying salt water irrigations.  Although sinusitis is most often due to a viral infection, a doctor may sometimes prescribe antibiotics if symptoms last 10 or more days or if they worsen. At this point, the doctor may suspect a bacterial infection.  When a person has chronic sinusitis, a doctor may recommend surgery to open the sinus passages and facilitate drainage.   Sialadenitis  is a rare condition in which the salivary gland in the mouth becomes infected and swollen. The infection typically affects the parotid gland in front of the ear or the submandibular gland beneath the chin.  Sialadenitis can cause pain on one side of the mouth or face, near the infected gland. Other symptoms can include:  People with persistent mouth dryness or a blocked salivary gland are more likely to develop sialadenitis. However, there is not always an obvious cause.  A doctor may prescribe antibiotics to people with a bacterial infection. They may also recommend drinking plenty of fluids and consuming foods and drinks that stimulate saliva production, such as hard, sour candies and lemon juice.  People with severe, worsening, or persistent facial pain should speak to a doctor. Also, seek medical attention for symptoms that may indicate an infection, such as:  To diagnose facial pain, a doctor will usually begin by asking a person about their symptoms and medical history.  They may also conduct a physical examination.  To aid their diagnosis, the doctor may order imaging tests such as  CT scans ,  MRI scans , or an X-ray.  They may also perform nerve conduction studies to determine how well the nerves in a person's face are working.  People can usually treat mild facial pain at home. The effectiveness of self-care treatments depends on the underlying cause, but some suggestions include:  Some people may also find complementary therapies such as  acupuncture , chiropractic treatment, and biofeedback beneficial for facial pain.  Facial pain may often relate to headaches and injuries. However, other causes include dental problems, infections, and nerve disorders.  People with severe, recurring, or persistent facial pain should see a doctor, who will be able to help determine the underlying cause and recommend possible treatments.
