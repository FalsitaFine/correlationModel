 However, the term anti-cancer supplements can be a little misleading. Some supplements may help reduce a person's risk of developing  cancer  or support the body during cancer treatment, but no supplement can replace standard cancer therapies.  Anyone considering taking  vitamins  and supplements during cancer treatment should seek advice from their doctor first, particularly as some can interact with other medications or cause side effects.  In this article, we discuss some of the dietary supplements that may help prevent cancer or assist in recovery during cancer treatment. We also cover risks and considerations.  Omega-3s are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are naturally present in a variety of foods, including:  Some research suggests that  omega-3  fatty acids may help prevent some types of cancer.  For example, a  2015 review  found some evidence that the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s may lower a person's risk of developing  breast cancer .  However, a  2019 clinical trial  investigated the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in 25,871 people.  The researchers found that participants who took omega-3 supplements did not have an overall reduced risk of cancer compared to those who took a  placebo . There was also no association between taking omega-3 supplements and a lower risk of breast, colorectal, or  prostate cancers .  Dietary supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids are widely available in health stores and pharmacies in a variety of different forms,  including :  A person can also purchase omega-3 supplements  online .  The  Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)  recommend a daily intake of 1.1–1.6 grams (g) of omega-3 fatty acids for people aged 14 years and upwards. A person should talk to their doctor before taking omega-3 supplements, as they can interact with some medications.   Green tea  is a popular drink that is rich in compounds called polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and  antioxidant  properties. Supplements containing extracts from green tea and its main active component, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), may help in the fight against cancer.  According to a  2018 review , EGCG and green tea extracts may help prevent or delay cancer onset, cancer recurrence, and secondary growths from cancer.  However, the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)  state that studies of green tea and cancer in humans have so far produced inconsistent results.  Drinking one or more cups of green tea each day is a simple way to enjoy its potential health benefits. A person can buy a variety of different green teas  online .  Green tea extracts are also readily available as dietary supplements, and people can purchase many of these  online  as well. However, some may find these extracts to be too concentrated.  According to the  NCCIH , green tea can interact with nadolol, which is a medication for treating  high blood pressure  and heart problems. People currently taking this medication should speak to their doctor before using green tea products.  Garlic and  onions  belong to the  Allium  genus of plants.  According to a  2015 review , eating more of these plants may help lower the risk of certain cancers, particularly in the digestive tract. However, the effect is difficult for researchers to quantify, and it is not clear how much of these vegetables a person needs to eat.  A  2018 study  found that garlic extract blocks the growth of some types of cancer cell in test tube experiments and mice models.  However, the researchers also noted that some studies suggest that garlic extract may increase the activity of some  chemotherapy  drugs. As such, anyone undergoing cancer treatment should talk to their doctor before using garlic extract.  Garlic extract supplements are available to purchase  online .   Ginger  is a traditional remedy for digestive issues and  may also help to relieve  the side effects of nausea and vomiting that chemotherapy and  radiation therapy  can often cause.  Making tea from boiled ginger root or eating natural candied ginger throughout the day may help relieve these side effects. People can also buy a variety of ginger tea  online .  Herbal supplements containing ginger extract are also available to purchase  online . However, these extracts may be too concentrated for some people.  There is some concern that ginger may interact with blood thinners, so people taking these medications should consult a doctor before adding ginger to their diet.  Turmeric is an orange spice that is a common ingredient in Asian foods, such as curry. Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  According to a  2016 review , studies suggest that curcumin can slow  tumor  growth and cause cancer cells to die. However, much of the research is from test tube studies and animal models, and scientists need to carry out more research in humans to confirm the findings.  Both the whole root and the ground spice form of turmeric are widely available in grocery stores. A person can try adding turmeric to curries, rice dishes, soups, and other meals. Turmeric is also available as a tea and a dietary supplement.  A person can buy a range of different turmeric and curcumin products online, including:   Vitamin D  is essential for healthy bones, teeth, and muscles and also plays a vital role in the function of nerves and the immune system.  According to the  National Cancer Institute (NCI) , research in mice indicates that vitamin D may slow or prevent the growth or development of cancer. The NCI also note that some studies in humans suggest that higher intakes of vitamin D may lower the risk of certain types of cancer. However, the results so far have been inconsistent, and scientists need to carry out more research.  The  ODS recommend  a daily intake of 600 international units (IU) or 15 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D for most people.  Many people can get enough vitamin D from sun exposure. The body naturally produces vitamin D when the skin becomes directly exposed to sunlight.  Vitamin D is also present in a limited number of foods,  including :  Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms:  Both of these forms increase vitamin D levels in the body in a similar manner. A person can buy vitamin D supplements  online .  Antioxidants counteract free radicals in the body, which may help protect against oxidative  stress  and cellular damage. Oxidative stress may play a role in the development of cancer and some other diseases.  However, the  NCI report  that clinical trials to date have not provided evidence that taking antioxidant supplements can lower a person's risk of developing cancer. They also point out that some studies suggest that antioxidant supplements may worsen outcomes during cancer treatment, particularly in people who smoke.   Other studies  in mice with tumors also found that antioxidants can promote tumor growth and metastasis, which is when cancer spreads to other parts of the body.  The  NCI recommend  that people undergoing cancer treatment speak to the doctor before taking antioxidant supplements.  A range of antioxidant supplements are widely available in health stores and pharmacies, and people can also buy them online. Examples include:  While doctors consider dietary supplements to be generally safe, some may cause side effects or interact with medications. People who are considering taking a dietary supplement should speak to their doctor first, particularly if they are currently taking any medications.  The  Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)  do not regulate dietary supplements as strictly as they regulate medications and do not routinely monitor them for quality, consistency, or safety. This means that it is essential that people purchase dietary supplements from reputable manufacturers.  Some herbal extract and vitamin supplements may help lower the risk of cancer or support the body during cancer therapy.  However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence for many of these supplements is limited or inconsistent. Also, dietary supplements cannot replace standard cancer therapies.  While dietary supplements are generally safe, some can cause side effects or interact with certain medications, including cancer drugs. It is, therefore, advisable to speak to a doctor before taking a dietary supplement, particularly people who are undergoing cancer treatment.  The FDA do not regulate dietary supplements in the same way that they regulate foods and drugs, so the quality and consistency of supplements can vary. People should only buy dietary supplements from reputable manufacturers.
