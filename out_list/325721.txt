 Azithromycin is an  antibiotic  in the macrolides class. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved azithromycin in  1991 .  Like all antibiotics, azithromycin can only fight certain bacteria. For this reason, it is important to talk to a doctor before taking the drug. It is not effective against viral infections or as a pain reliever.  This article provides an overview of azithromycin, including its uses, side effects, warnings, and drug interactions.  Azithromycin can fight a wide range of bacteria, including many in the  Streptococcus  family. It can stop harmful bacteria from growing.  Healthcare providers tend to use this drug to treat mild-to-moderate infections of the lungs, sinuses, skin, and other body parts.  A doctor may prescribe azithromycin to treat  the following  bacterial infections:  Azithromycin is a prescription medication. Therefore, people should not take it without a prescription.  The drug is available in the form of a tablet, an oral suspension solution, an eye drop, and an injection. The best type and dosage depends on the infection a person has.  People can take the drug with or without food. They should thoroughly shake the liquid form before use.  Some examples of common dosages  include :  Using antibiotics incorrectly  can lead  to the development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, meaning that antibiotics no longer work against them. This is called antibiotic resistance.  When taking azithromycin or any other antibiotic, people should heed the following precautions:   Learn more about antibiotic resistance here .  Like all drugs, azithromycin can have certain side effects. These are usually minor. In clinical trials, only  0.7%  of people stopped taking Zithromax because of its side effects.  Most of the side effects that led people to stop taking the drug were gastrointestinal, such as:  Less common side effects, occurring in up to 1% of cases, include:  Serious side effects are rare but can include:  People who have  myasthenia gravis , a condition that causes muscle weakness, may develop worsening symptoms or breathing problems.  People with a history of allergic reactions to macrolides or ketolides should not take azithromycin.  Doctors should not prescribe this drug to treat pneumonia if a person:  People should not rely on azithromycin to treat  syphilis .  A person should speak to a doctor about any existing heart, kidney, and liver conditions before taking azithromycin, including an irregular heartbeat and especially QT prolongation.  A  large 2012 cohort study  found a small increase in the risk of cardiovascular death among people taking azithromycin. The risk was higher among those with other risk factors for  heart disease , such as smoking, low physical activity levels, and a high body mass index ( BMI ).  The study reported that when compared with amoxicillin, there were 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million azithromycin prescriptions. Among people with the highest risk of heart disease, there were 245 more deaths per 1 million courses of azithromycin.  This suggests that other antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, may be a safer option for people with heart disease or certain types of heart arrythmias.   In 2018 , the FDA issued a warning about the long term use of azithromycin in people with certain blood or lymph node  cancers  who have  stem cell  transplants. Emerging research has suggested that azithromycin may increase the risk of cancer relapse in these people.  Following a stem cell transplant, some people take azithromycin to reduce the risk of an inflammatory lung condition called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The FDA have not approved azithromycin for this use, however.  Rarely, azithromycin can cause liver toxicity. People should stop taking the drug and call their doctor if they develop any symptoms of liver problems, including dark urine, itching, or yellow eyes.  In newborns  younger than 42 days old , azithromycin may cause a dangerous condition called infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Caregivers should contact a doctor if a baby becomes irritable or vomits when eating.  Azithromycin may interact with other medications a person is taking.  For example, using azithromycin while taking nelfinavir, which is a drug that helps treat  HIV , can increase the risk of liver abnormalities and hearing problems.  Azithromycin can also increase the effects of blood thinners such as warfarin.  Other drugs that may interact with azithromycin include:  A person should tell a doctor about all current medications, supplements, and remedies before taking azithromycin. Always speak to a doctor before stopping taking medications.  Azithromycin may be safe to use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.  Studies of animals who received very large doses of azithromycin did not find an increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects.  However, there have been no high quality studies in pregnant humans, so the drug label currently states that " azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed ."  Azithromycin  can transfer into  breast milk and may remain present for 48 hours following a person's last dose. Although it is generally safe to use when breastfeeding, azithromycin may cause diarrhea, vomiting, or a rash in some babies.  A person should tell a doctor if they are pregnant, might be pregnant, or are breastfeeding before taking azithromycin. If a nursing infant develops side effects while the parent is taking azithromycin, call a doctor for advice.  The brand name version of azithromycin (Zithromax) is typically more expensive than the generic version.  However, the price may vary depending on the pharmacy, a person's insurance coverage and deductibles, and their geographic location.  Azithromycin treats many of the same infections that drugs such as  penicillin  and amoxicillin can treat.  A doctor may prescribe azithromycin as an alternative to other antibiotics because it typically requires a shorter course. It is also a good option for people with a history of allergies to other medications, or when other antibiotics do not work.  Because the risk of heart health problems is higher with azithromycin than with some other antibiotics, people with heart disease or  arrhythmias  should ask their doctor about trying a different antibiotic.  Azithromycin is an antibiotic that can treat many types of bacterial infection. It can also prevent these infections from getting worse or spreading.  Like all antibiotics, it presents some risks, so it is important to only take it under the guidance of a medical professional.
