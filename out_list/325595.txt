 Some aspects of  ADHD  may also be symptoms of other conditions. Due to the complex nature of the condition, some people may receive an incorrect diagnosis.  This is due to a wide range of diagnostic issues. Here, we look at some of the factors and conditions that can lead to a misdiagnosis of ADHD.  Doctors can misdiagnose ADHD in children due to their age. In fact, children who start school at a younger age  more frequently  receive a diagnosis of ADHD.  If a child starts school having just turned 5 years old while some of their peers are closer to 6 years old, there is an approximate  20%  difference in age.  One  study  found that children born in December, which was the school cutoff age, were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis than those born in January.  The date a child is born does not affect their chance of ADHD, as it is a neurodevelopmental condition. What this research does suggest, however, is that misdiagnosis can happen depending on the maturity levels of a developing child when they receive a diagnosis.  It is also important to note that having difficulty paying attention and being overactive may be normal behavior for children of a certain age.   Some research  has found that boys receive a diagnosis of ADHD more often than girls, with a ratio ranging from 3:1 to 9:1 of boys to girls with an ADHD diagnosis.  Researchers suggest that this is because girls tend to display more symptoms of inattention than boys. Boys may instead show symptoms of hyperactivity, which are more noticeable.  More obvious displays of the symptoms of ADHD may result in an ADHD diagnosis.  Mood disorders include:  Some theories suggest that mood disorders can occur due to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, stressful life events, or as a response to major illness or medication.  Some symptoms of mood disorders can be similar to those of ADHD, such as:  A psychologist, psychiatrist, or other  mental health  professional can diagnose a mood disorder by conducting an assessment and applying diagnostic criteria to a person's symptoms.   Autism , also called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can have some symptoms that may appear similar to ADHD.  These can include:  ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social skills.  Symptoms of ASD can include:  Healthcare professionals such as neurologists and psychologists can carry out a detailed examination to diagnose ASD.   Anxiety  disorders can cause people to feel constantly anxious, have  panic attacks , or experience  phobias .  Some of the symptoms of anxiety disorders can be similar to those of ADHD, such as:  Anxiety disorder can also cause people to feel uncontrollable worry, become tired quickly, or have an excessive fear about a particular situation or object.  A doctor or psychotherapist can diagnose anxiety disorder by taking a thorough medical history and applying diagnostic criteria to the person's symptoms.  If people experience sleep problems such as  insomnia  or  obstructive sleep apnea  (OSA), it can cause similar symptoms to ADHD, including:  People with insomnia have difficulty falling or staying asleep.  OSA is a condition wherein the upper airway keeps getting blocked while asleep, which restricts airflow. People with OSA may:  A doctor may take a medical history, carry out a physical examination, and suggest a sleep study — during which they can monitor activity during sleep — to diagnose a sleep condition.  Auditory processing disorder (APD) is a condition that makes it difficult for people to understand the sounds of words correctly. APD affects the way a person's  central nervous system  interprets information.  People with ADHD can correctly process auditory information through their central nervous system; it is the deficit of attention that impacts how they take in and use that information.  Symptoms can be similar to ADHD and may include:  A doctor cannot diagnose APD by looking at symptoms alone, as there may be many other causes for the communication, language, or learning difficulties.  An audiologist can diagnose APD by carrying out a variety of tests that look at responses to sound.  Allergies and  celiac disease  can create symptoms similar to those of ADHD.  In children, celiac disease can cause irritability and behavioral issues. In adults, celiac disease can cause  fatigue , depression, and anxiety.  A  2011 study  looked at 67 people ages 7–42. Out of the 67 participants, 10 had celiac disease. After 6 months of following a gluten-free diet, those with celiac disease had large improvements in their ADHD symptoms.  Untreated celiac disease may increase the likelihood of symptoms of ADHD. The researchers suggest that people should get tested for celiac disease as part of an ADHD diagnosis to help prevent a misdiagnosis.  Some other conditions that can present similar symptoms to ADHD include:  Because many of the symptoms of ADHD overlap with those of many other conditions, misdiagnosis can occur.  If ADHD is not the cause of the symptoms, they can become worse with the stimulants the doctor prescribes for treatment.  If a person displays symptoms of ADHD, it is important that they talk to their healthcare provider and go through a variety of tests to ensure that they receive the correct diagnosis and treatment.
