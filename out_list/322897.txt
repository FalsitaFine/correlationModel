 The anti-inflammatory diet can help relieve joint pain and reduce  inflammation .  According to the  Arthritis Foundation , certain foods can help tackle inflammation, strengthen bones, and boost the immune system.  Following a specific anti-inflammatory meal plan can help people make tasty, nutritious food while helping to keep their inflammation under control.  The anti-inflammatory diet contains plenty of prebiotics, fiber,  antioxidants , and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish.  Read on for 26 anti-inflammatory recipes to try for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.  Start off the day with the following nutritious anti-inflammatory recipes:  Oats with berries delivers high doses of prebiotics, antioxidants, and fiber.  Oats are high in a type of fiber called beta-glucans. Beta-glucans are an important prebiotic for the gut bacteria  Bifidobacterium , which  may help  reduce diabetes-related inflammation and  obesity .  Prebiotics help the healthy gut bacteria to flourish, which can help reduce inflammation.  Berries are high in antioxidants, and  blueberries  are especially high in anti-inflammatory polyphenols called  anthocyanins .   Dietary tip : Traditional rolled and steel cut oats are higher in fiber than quick oats.   Recipe   Buckwheat groats are gluten-free and a great substitute for oats for people who are sensitive to gluten.  Adding chia seeds will boost the healthful  omega-3  content of this breakfast choice.  Omega-3s help reduce inflammation in the body, and  research shows  that they can improve joint tenderness and stiffness in people with RA.  Chia seeds are also high in fiber and protein, which will keep people feeling full for longer.   Recipe   Buckwheat is also a good source of two key anti-inflammatory polyphenols called quercetin and rutin.  According to a  2016 study , quercetin is an antioxidant, while rutin has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help with  arthritis .  Despite its name, buckwheat is not a grain. It is the seed of a fruit and is gluten-free. Buckwheat is especially popular in Japanese cuisine.  Many health food supermarkets and  online stores  sell buckwheat.   Recipe   Eggs are an excellent source of protein, and the egg yolk contains  vitamin D .  A  2016 review  stated that  vitamin  D could limit the process of inflammation due to its effects on the immune system. The report also noted that people with RA had lower vitamin D levels than other people studied.  Add turmeric to scrambled eggs for an extra anti-inflammatory boost. Turmeric is rich in a compound called curcumin, which  studies suggest  can help manage oxidative and inflammatory conditions.   Recipe   Salmon and avocado are both rich sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids.  Eating plenty of healthful fatty acids can also improve heart health and lower a person's risk of cardiovascular disease.  This hearty breakfast is great for very active days or weekend brunches. For gluten-free options, use gluten-free bread.   Recipe   A smoothie is a good breakfast on the go. A smoothie is full of fiber and protein, which makes people feel fuller for longer.  Pineapple contains high levels of bromelain, which has  anti-inflammatory properties . There is growing interest in bromelain supplements due to its anti-inflammatory properties.   Recipe   For lunch, try these nutritious recipes:  Choose this healthful vegetarian version of the Reuben for an anti-inflammatory boost.  Sauerkraut contains probiotics that are essential for a person's gut bacteria. Probiotics  may have an impact  on arthritis-related inflammation by improving inflammation in the intestinal tract.  This grilled sandwich contains all the benefits of sauerkraut but contains less salt and  calories  than the Reuben. Adding hummus and avocado to replace the meat, provides protein and a smooth, creamy texture.   Recipe   Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, contain high levels of two polyphenols called quercetin and coenzyme Q10.  Coenzyme Q10 may reduce inflammation in some metabolic diseases,  including  RA,  multiple sclerosis  (MS), and  diabetes .  Frittatas are quick and easy to make, and people can enjoy experimenting with a range of flavors. Having a side salad adds further benefits from vegetables.   Recipe   A  quinoa  and citrus fruit salad is gluten-free and great for people on a vegan diet. Quinoa contains lots of protein and nutrients.  Add citrus fruits, such as lemon, lime, or grapefruit, to the salad for an antioxidant boost. Citrus fruits are full of vitamin C, which is  an important antioxidant  that can also help renew other antioxidants in the body.  Vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron from plant-based sources, such as spinach and quinoa.  Quinoa is easy to cook and store, so people can prepare it ahead of time and keep it in the fridge until needed.   Recipe   Lentil salads are a simple, protein-rich lunchtime option for people on a vegetarian diet.  Lentils and beetroot increase the fiber content, while the hazelnuts provide extra protein and vitamin E. Vitamin E is an  antioxidant .  Beetroots contain high amounts of a compound called betaine. Betaine is an  anti-inflammatory and antioxidant .   Recipe   A cauliflower steak is a great vegetarian and vegan option to steak.  Cauliflower is high in fiber and antioxidants.

One  study  found that women who ate more cruciferous vegetables had lower inflammation biomarkers.   Recipe   Trout is a fatty fish that contains anti-inflammatory omega-3s.  To make this meal more filling, try using wholemeal or gluten-free wraps, or adding brown rice as a side.  To ensure this recipe is gluten-free, check the  nutrition  label on the fish sauce. If it contains gluten, people may choose to leave it out. Skip the sweet chili sauce to lower the sugar content.   Recipe   Try the following recipes for a healthful and filling dinner:  Zucchini pasta is a great gluten-free alternative to pasta.

Sweet potatoes are a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and B-vitamins. They also contain  calcium , iron, and healthful antioxidants.  Use leftover roast chicken or store-bought chicken to save time.   Recipe   Salmon and cauliflower rice is a nutritious, simple option for an evening meal. Subbing cauliflower rice for regular rice can help increase veggies intake, decrease calories, and provide extra nutrients.  Add healthful green vegetables to go towards the daily recommended vegetable intake of  2â€“3 cups .  Brussel sprouts and cauliflower are both cruciferous vegetables high in fiber, antioxidants, and polyphenols.   Cooking tip : Not entirely sold on cauliflower rice? Try a combo of cauliflower and brown rice together.   Recipe   Shrimp is another good food to include because it contains astaxanthin, which has  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects .  Add carrots, red peppers, and peas for their healthful polyphenol content.  Try adding 2 tbsp. of turmeric for extra inflammatory benefits.  Turmeric is nearly tasteless so people can use it in all curries, soups, and casseroles.   Recipe   Vegetarian chili is a versatile dish. With a variety of beans full of fermentable fibers, this chili looks after gut health.  Beans are also good sources of antioxidant vitamin C and are high in plant proteins.

These nachos are high in turmeric, which can help reduce inflammation.  They also contain almond meal, making them a good source of antioxidant vitamin E.   Recipe   Matcha is a  green tea  powder. Many people use it to make tea, lattes, or tasty smoothie bowls.  Like other green teas and black tea, matcha is high in a polyphenol called epigallocatechin (EGCG). These compounds provide  anti-inflammatory benefits .  Matcha is available through most tea specialists, Asian grocers, or  online .   Recipe   It is easy to make trail mix at home by mixing together nuts and seeds.
