 These infections can develop in various locations throughout the body, including the penis and scrotum. In females, the medical term for a genital yeast infection is vulvovaginal  candidiasis . Yeast infections in the mouth or throat are called thrush.  Usually, the vagina has healthful levels of yeast. However,  changes in the environment  of the vagina can cause an overgrowth of yeast, resulting in infection.  Infection and  inflammation  of the vagina can sometimes cause a small amount of bleeding, as well as discharge, itchiness, and soreness around the genital area.  In this article, we cover other symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection. We also describe prevention techniques, treatment options, when to see a doctor, and what else can cause genital bleeding.  A yeast infection can sometimes cause a small amount of bleeding or spotting.  If a person experiences reoccurring or heavy bleeding, they should see a doctor to determine whether it is a symptom of a yeast infection, a different type of infection, or another underlying health condition.  When a yeast infection is present, a person may notice thick, white vaginal discharge. This may be watery or resemble cottage cheese. It does not typically smell bad.

Trichomoniasis  is an STI that can cause light bleeding after sex. Symptoms usually present in females, rather than males.  Other symptoms of trichomoniasis include:  People with trichomoniasis and any sexual partners can take oral antibiotics to treat the infection.  A  urinary tract infection  (UTI) can cause blood to appear in the urine. Other symptoms of a UTI include:  A person should see a doctor if they notice blood in their urine or any of the above symptoms. The doctor can prescribe antibiotics to treat a UTI.   Kidney stones  can cause blood to appear in the urine.  Some kidney stones pass out of the body without the person noticing. Larger kidney stones can be painful, and people may experience the following symptoms:  A person should see a doctor if they think they have a kidney stone. If the stone does not pass by itself, medication and shock wave therapy can break up the stone and help it pass more easily.

The following factors can also result in unexplained bleeding in the pelvic area:  If a person notices blood in their urine or vaginal bleeding between periods, they should see a doctor to find out the cause.  Anyone who suspects that they have a yeast infection should consult a doctor for a diagnosis and treatment.  The doctor will perform a physical examination of the pelvic area to look for discharge, redness, swelling, and any other signs of a yeast infection.  They may also use a swab to take a sample from the vagina, which they will send to a laboratory for testing. This can show whether there is an overgrowth of  Candida  yeast.  Antifungal medication can treat a yeast infection. People can take this medication orally or as a topical cream or vaginal suppository.  Prescription and over-the-counter antifungal medications are available. A doctor may prescribe a single dose of an antifungal drug called fluconazole. If a person opts for over-the-counter medication instead, they may need to take it for around  1â€“7 days .  Before using an over-the-counter medication, it is essential to have a doctor check that there really is a yeast infection, rather than another type of infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection can be similar to those of other infections, such as STIs.  Avoid having sex during treatment because sex can slow down the healing process. Some yeast infection medications can also weaken condoms and cause them to break.  People with reoccurring yeast infections may need a longer course of antifungal medication, possibly for up to  6 months .  A person may be able to prevent vaginal yeast infections from reoccurring by:  Yeast infections are easy to treat with antifungal medication.  A small amount of bleeding or spotting can result from a yeast infection. If a person has regular or heavy bleeding between periods, they should see a doctor.
