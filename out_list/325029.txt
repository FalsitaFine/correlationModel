 In this article, we describe 14 exercises that can help strengthen the hips, improve joint mobility, and relieve hip pain.  Flexibility and strength exercises are key to relieving hip pain. Although these exercises may result in temporary discomfort, they should not cause or aggravate pain. If an exercise causes pain, stop doing it or try going at a slower or gentler pace.  Individuals who have recently had a hip replacement should consult a doctor or physical therapist before performing any of the exercises below.  The first four exercises stretch the muscles around the hip joint, which can help reduce stiffness and improve joint mobility.  A person should perform these exercises at times when they are feeling the least amount of pain and stiffness. A good time to do them is after a warm shower or bath when the muscles are most relaxed.  Begin with one or two exercises a day, three times a week. If this feels comfortable, try doing several exercises once a day.  The aim of these exercises is to strengthen the hip muscles to better support the hip joint, which can help relieve pain.  Resistance training is a form of exercise for developing muscular strength. In resistance training, a person uses either low weights or their body mass to create resistance for their muscles to work against.  People who experience hip pain or discomfort for more than an hour following these exercises should reduce the number of repetitions accordingly.  To perform  knee lifts :  Repeat this exercise 5–10 times on each knee.  To perform  external hip rotations :  Repeat the stretch 5–10 times.  To perform  double hip rotations :  To perform  hip and lower back stretches :  To perform  hip flexions :  Do 5–10 repetitions of this exercise.  To perform  hip extensions :  Repeat this stretch 5–10 times on each leg. To increase the resistance, try attaching small weights to the legs.  To perform  hip abduction exercises :  Do this exercise 5–10 times on one leg, then repeat it on the other side.  To perform  heel-to-buttock exercises :  Aim to do 5–10 repetitions on each leg.  To perform  mini squats :  Repeat these mini squats 5–10 times.      To perform  short-arc quadriceps exercises :  Do 5–10 lifts on one leg and then switch to the opposite leg.  To perform  quadriceps exercises :  Do 5–10 repetitions.  To perform a  bridge :  Repeat this exercise 5–10 times.  To perform a  chair stand :  Repeat this exercise 4–6 times to begin with before gradually building up to 12 repetitions.  To perform  abdominal exercises :  Repeat this exercise 5–10 times.  Gently stretching and exercising the hips can help relieve pain, increase mobility, and strengthen muscles. There are many exercises to choose from, but people can experiment to find the ones that work best for them and then incorporate these exercises into a routine.  A person can also work with a physical therapist to design an individualized exercise plan to suit their needs.  People with severe, persistent, or worsening hip pain should see a doctor. It is important to stop or reduce any exercises that cause or aggravate hip pain.
