 Many people will observe small, red bumps on the skin immediately after waxing. Others may notice them about a week later.  This article describes some of the possible causes of bumps after waxing, as well as some treatment options and prevention tips.  The following are some common causes of bumps after waxing:   Contact dermatitis  occurs due to an allergic reaction or irritation.  Fragranced soaps and detergents are common culprits, but the wax and any chemicals it contains may also contribute to contact dermatitis.  Usually, the bumps that occur after contact dermatitis are very itchy. Contact dermatitis can also cause the following symptoms:  Folliculitis causes itchy bumps that may have a red ring around them. They may also look similar to those of  acne .   Folliculitis  occurs due to damage following hair removal. Damaged hair follicles are more vulnerable to invading bacteria. When bacteria — such as staph bacteria, which are naturally present on the skin — infect the hair follicles, folliculitis can occur.  Wearing very tight clothing that rubs against the hair follicles can cause further irritation and may make the condition worse.  According to one study in the   International Journal of Dermatology  , of 28 women who developed folliculitis after waxing, an estimated 100% had waxed their arms.  The authors conclude that a person is more likely to develop folliculitis on the parts of their limbs that are closest to the body, such as the thighs and upper arms.  An  ingrown hair  may appear about a week after waxing. Ingrown hairs occur when the hair grows and reinserts itself into the hair follicle.  Ingrown hairs can cause itchy and sometimes painful bumps that often look like  pimples  on the skin. Without treatment, ingrown hairs can become infected.  Symptoms of an infection include the hair follicle leaking  pus , the area feeling warm to the touch, and in some cases, an  ingrown hair cyst .  In most cases, a person can treat bumps after waxing at home.  Try to keep the area clean, dry, and moisturized, as this can help reduce irritation until the skin has recovered from waxing.  Some home remedies that can soothe bumps after waxing include:  A person should see their doctor if the bumps start showing signs of infection. If this does occur, it will usually do so starting 2–3 days after waxing.  A doctor may prescribe an  antibiotic  ointment or oral antibiotics to treat the infection. These either prevent further bacteria from growing or kill off existing bacteria on the skin.  A person can take steps to help prevent bumps after waxing different areas of the body. These include:  Before waxing the face, it is best to:  When washing the face, avoid scrubbing or rubbing the skin with a towel. This could further irritate waxed skin.  Exfoliating the skin using a gentle sugar scrub or body brush before waxing can help both reduce dead skin cells and enhance waxing results.  A person should also wear loose fitting clothing after waxing.  Refraining from picking at or scratching bumps after waxing can also help reduce the risk of further complications.  Bumps that occur after waxing are usually temporary and will resolve without treatment.  If they persist beyond a few days or start showing signs of infection — such as redness, warmth, or swelling — a person should speak to their doctor. If the bumps persist after every wax, a person should consider using different waxing products, or speak to their aesthetician about ways to reduce skin bumps.
