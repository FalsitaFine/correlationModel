 According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ,  cancer  was the second leading cause of death in the United States in 2016.  Healthcare providers can run diagnostic tests that identify early-stage cancers. Treatment has a better chance of success when a person receives their cancer diagnosis early.  In this article, we discuss general warning signs of cancer unique to women, men, and cancer type.  Cancers specific to or more common among women include endometrial, cervical, and  breast cancers . Warning signs include:  Breast cancer often causes visible changes in the breast tissue, so it is crucial for women to be familiar with the shape, size, and texture of their breasts.  Breast changes to look out for include:  Women should speak with a healthcare provider if they notice any changes in their breast tissue. The American Cancer Society recommend that women aged  40 years and older  have regular mammograms to screen for signs of breast cancer.  Women who experience regular periods may want to consult their healthcare provider if they experience vaginal bleeding or spotting outside of their usual cycle. Irregular vaginal bleeding may indicate endometrial or cervical cancers.  Women who have gone through  menopause  should seek immediate medical attention if they have any vaginal bleeding.  Spotting does not always occur as a result of cancer. Hormonal  birth control , chronic medical conditions, and  stress  can also cause spotting.  Women should consider seeking immediate medical attention if they experience spotting alongside the following symptoms:  Certain warning signs of cancer occur exclusively or more frequently in men than women. These can include:  Although  testicular cancer  in men is rare, rates of new diagnoses continue increasing around the world. The American Cancer Society estimates roughly  9,560 people  in the U.S. will receive a testicular cancer diagnosis in 2019.  A hard, painless lump in the testicle is a symptom of testicular cancer. Other symptoms of testicular cancer include:  A persistent change in bowel habits can indicate cancers of the colon or rectum, which people collectively refer to as  colorectal cancers .  Colorectal cancer can cause frequent  diarrhea  or  constipation  and persistent abdominal pain. Other symptoms include:  Colorectal cancers can cause bleeding in the digestive tract. Stools may contain visible blood or appear darker than usual.  Having rectal bleeding or bloody stools does not necessarily mean a person has cancer.  Hemorrhoids , ulcers, and other gastrointestinal disorders can all cause bleeding.  However, men should not ignore this symptom and should see a doctor immediately, as it may signify a serious medical problem.  Changes in urinary habits is a symptom of both prostate and bladder cancers.  Both forms of cancer can impact the urinary tract and cause the following symptoms:   Prostate  and  bladder cancers  are among the most common types of cancer among men in the U.S.  The following sections look at the warning signs specific to different cancers.   Skin cancer  is the most common type of cancer in the U.S.  There are two types of skin cancers — nonmelanoma and  melanoma . According to the National Cancer Institute,  1,195,608 people in the U.S.  were living with skin melanoma in 2016.  Skin cancer can develop on any part of the skin, but it often appears in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as the face, neck, arms, and hands.  The main types of skin cancer include basal cell  carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Although less common, melanoma is generally more dangerous than nonmelanoma skin cancers.  A basal cell carcinoma typically looks like a shiny, yellow lump or a bleeding sore that heals and reopens.  A squamous cell carcinoma can appear as either a firm, red bump or a flat, scaly lesion.  Melanoma can develop on regular skin or inside an existing mole. Signs of melanoma include:  Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women, according to the  National Breast Cancer Foundation .  According to the American Cancer Society, women in the U.S have about a  12% chance of developing breast cancer  in their lifetime.  Besides the appearance of a painless lump in the breast tissue, warning signs of breast cancer include:   Lung cancer  does not always produce noticeable symptoms in the early stages. If symptoms do appear, people can mistake them for acute respiratory infections or a cold.  Warning signs of lung cancer include:   Prostate cancer  does not usually produce early warning signs. In some cases, prostate cancer can produce non-specific symptoms, such as:   Liver cancer  produces symptoms that usually have links with gastrointestinal or digestive problems. The appearance of  jaundice , which causes yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, might be an indication of liver damage.  Other warning signs of liver cancer include:   Leukemia  is a form of cancer that affects the blood and  bone marrow  — the spongy tissue responsible for producing new blood cells.  The signs and symptoms of leukemia vary between people, but they can include:  Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  develops in the lymph nodes and lymphatic tissue that is present inside the stomach, intestines, or skin.  Swelling in one or more lymph nodes is the most common early sign of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This form of cancer can start in other sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract, bones, or skin.  Symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include:  Early forms of cancer may not cause noticeable symptoms. Several of the warning signs of cancer in this article are non-specific symptoms that can have many other conditions as the cause.  However, people should not wait to get medical attention. Early diagnosis can lead to early, more effective treatment.  The  National Cancer Institute  recommend that people see a healthcare provider if symptoms last longer than 2 weeks.  People should speak with a healthcare provider about any new or worsening symptoms, especially if they have a family history of cancer or have certain factors that increase their risk of cancer.  People should seek immediate medical attention if symptoms interfere with their daily lives.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death around the world.  Although early forms of cancer do not always produce noticeable symptoms, knowing the warning signs of cancer can help motivate people to seek medical care early. Common signs of cancer include:  Having these symptoms does not necessarily mean a person has cancer. People should seek medical attention if their symptoms last longer than 2 weeks.
