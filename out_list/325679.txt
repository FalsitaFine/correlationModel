 Regardless of the cause, people with  diarrhea  that lasts for more than  2 days  should see a doctor right away. If a person does not receive treatment, severe diarrhea can lead to serious complications, such as  dehydration  and malabsorption.  In this article, we discuss some conditions that can cause both lower  back pain  and diarrhea and explore their treatment options. We also describe when to see a doctor.   Celiac disease  is an immune reaction to gluten that causes  inflammation  in the small intestine and affects body's ability to digest nutrients. Gluten is a protein naturally present in wheat, barely, and rye.  Celiac disease tends to affect children and adults differently, and symptoms can vary considerably from person to person. However, it often causes chronic diarrhea, and some adults experience bone and joint pain, which may develop in the lower back.  Some other symptoms of celiac disease can include:  The main treatment for celiac disease is switching to a gluten-free diet. A doctor may refer a person to a dietician, who can give advice about avoiding gluten while still eating healthful, balanced meals.  It is also important to check that other products do not contain gluten, including:   Dysmenorrhea  is the medical term for painful menstrual periods. According to a  2015 review  article, dysmenorrhea affects 45–95% of people who menstruate.  In addition to painful cramping in the abdomen, some people also experience pelvic pain that radiates to the lower back.  Other symptoms of dysmenorrhea can include:  Many people with dysmenorrhea find relief from over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen,  aspirin , and naproxen.  If these treatments are unsuccessful, a doctor may prescribe stronger pain medications or  birth control  pills. They may also recommend tests to determine if there is an underlying cause for dysmenorrhea.  Other treatment options can include:  Diverticulosis is the term for small bulges or sacs — called diverticula — forming in the wall of the colon.  Diverticulosis does not always cause symptoms, but can it develop into  diverticulitis , which refers to the diverticula becoming infected and inflamed.  Diverticulitis can lead to severe intestinal complications, such as abscesses, perforations, bleeding, and blockages.  Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis can include:  Treatment for diverticulosis and diverticulitis depends on the type and severity of a person's symptoms. A doctor may recommend dietary changes, such as increasing the fiber intake and taking probiotics, if a person has mild symptoms.  For people with symptoms of diverticulitis, a doctor will usually prescribe  antibiotics  to treat the infection. Surgery may be necessary to treat serious intestinal complications.   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  is an umbrella term for conditions that cause inflammation and irritation along the digestive tract. The most common examples of IBD are  ulcerative colitis  and  Crohn's disease .  Symptoms of IBD can vary considerably among individuals, and they tend to come and go in cycles.  However, IBD often causes recurrent diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Some people also experience joint pain, which can develop in the lower back.  Some other symptoms of IBD include:  People with symptoms of IBD should see a doctor for an evaluation.  There is no cure for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, so treatment typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle and dietary changes. Doctors may also recommend bowel surgery to treat complications of IBD.  A  kidney infection , or pyelonephritis, occurs when a  urinary tract infection  (UTI) spreads to a kidney, usually from the bladder.  This represents the most serious stage of a UTI, and a person who does not receive prompt treatment from a physician may eventually may need care in a hospital.  Symptoms of a kidney infection can develop quickly and may include:  In people over the age of  65 years , kidneys infections can sometimes cause symptoms such as confusion, hallucinations, and difficulty speaking clearly.  A person with symptoms of a kidney infection should see a doctor right away. Doctors typically prescribe a course of antibiotics to kill the infection.  People who develop serious complications may require hospital treatment, which can include surgery, in rare circumstances.  See a doctor right away if diarrhea lasts for more than  2 days  or if symptoms of dehydration develop.  Also, see a doctor for severe or persistent lower back pain.  People should seek immediate medical attention if they have any of the following symptoms:  Diarrhea and lower back pain are common and may be unrelated. However, the two can also be symptoms of more serious conditions.  Some illnesses that can cause both diarrhea and lower back pain include celiac disease, IBD, kidney infections, and diverticulosis.  See a doctor right away if diarrhea lasts for more than 2 days or if symptoms of dehydration develop. Also, see a doctor if diarrhea or back pain occur with other concerning symptoms or if the pain is severe.
