 The  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)  note that the symptoms of a blood clot in a person's leg include swelling, red skin, pain in the leg, or the leg feeling warm to the touch. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , if a blood clot happens in a larger vein, this is a  deep vein thrombosis  (DVT).  The AHRQ say that blood clots are more likely to occur if a person is unable to move around a lot. This can be due to surgery, an injury, or sitting down for an extended period, such as on a long-haul flight.  According to the  National Center for Biotechnology Information , blood clots or DVT can cause obvious symptoms. However, they also note that DVT does not always have any associated symptoms.  Symptoms include:  According to the  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute , a person should contact their doctor immediately if they suspect they have DVT. This is because DVT can result in a  pulmonary embolism , where the blood clot moves to a person's lung.  The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include:  A pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate emergency treatment.  According to the  AHRQ , risk factors for a blood clot include:  According to the  CDC , the best way to prevent a blood clot or DVT is to maintain a healthy weight, avoid a sedentary lifestyle where possible, and follow any recommendations from a doctor.  The CDC also  recommend  that a person gets up and walks around regularly, and exercises their leg muscles, even when seated.  A person could try:  According to an article in the   Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis  , taking a low dose of  aspirin  might be effective at reducing the chances of developing blood clots or DVT.  It is possible to minimize the risk of developing a blood clot or DVT by avoiding clear risk factors and practicing prevention techniques, such as exercising muscles wherever possible.  If a person thinks they have had a blood clot in their leg, they should contact a doctor immediately.
