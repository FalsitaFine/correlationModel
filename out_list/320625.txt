 Manufacturers of appetite suppressant pills make big claims about the ability of pills to suppress appetite and promote weight loss. However, the effectiveness of these pills is not known, and according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), they  often come  with dangerous side effects.  Instead, a person can use a range of natural methods to suppress or lose their appetite in a risk-free, healthful way.  In this article, we give a list of evidence-based methods that a person can use to suppress their appetite without the need for diet pills. We also discuss which foods are the best appetite suppressants.  A person can use the following ten evidence-based methods to suppress their appetite and avoid overeating:  Not all foods satisfy hunger equally. Compared to  carbohydrates ,  protein  and certain  fats  are more effective for satisfying hunger and keeping people feeling full for longer.  A person can replace some sources of carbohydrate with proteins and healthful fats to help keep their appetite under control.  The  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  recommend the following high-protein foods:  The guidelines also recommend that a person gets their healthful fats from natural sources such as nuts and seeds, avocados, and olive oil.  Drinking a large glass of water directly before eating  has been found  to make a person feel fuller, more satisfied, and less hungry after the meal.   Another study , which looked at appetite in 50 overweight females, showed that drinking 1.5 liters of water a day for 8 weeks caused a reduction in appetite and weight, and also led to greater fat loss.  A soup starter may also quench the appetite.  Research from 2007  showed that people reported feeling fuller immediately after the meal if they had a liquid starter.  Fiber does not break down like other foods, so it stays in the body for longer. This slows down digestion and keeps people feeling full throughout the day.   Research suggests  that fiber can be an effective appetite suppressant. High-fiber diets are also associated with  lower obesity rates .  On the other hand,  another review  found that introducing extra fiber into the diet was effective in less than half of the studies they looked at.  More research is needed to identify which sources of fiber are the most effective for suppressing appetite.  Healthful high-fiber foods include:  Exercise is another healthy and effective appetite suppressant.   A review  based on 20 different studies found that appetite hormones are suppressed immediately after exercise, especially high-intensity workouts.  They found lower levels of ghrelin in the body, a hormone that makes us hungry, and higher levels of "fullness hormones" such as PPY and GLP-1.   Research shows  that a tea called Yerba Maté, which comes from the  Ilex paraguariensis  plant, can reduce appetite and improve mood when combined with high-intensity exercise. Yerba Maté is available for purchase  online .  Dark chocolate has been shown to suppresses appetite compared to milk chocolate.  One study  showed that people ate less during their next meal after snacking on dark instead of milk chocolate.  Consuming a small amount of  ginger  powder has been shown to  reduce appetite and increase fullness , possibly because of its stimulating effect on the digestive system. This was a small-scale study, so more research is needed to confirm this effect. Ginger powder is available for purchase  online .  Reducing general food intake while dieting can leave people with a ravenous appetite. This can cause a relapse into binge eating.  However, dieting does not have to mean going hungry. Some foods are high in nutrients and energy, but low in  calories . These include vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains.  Eating a large volume of these foods will stop the stomach from growling and still allow a person to burn more calories than they consume.  Comfort eating due to  stress , anger, or sadness is different from physical hunger.   Research  has linked stress with an increased desire to eat, binge eating, and eating non-nutritious food.  Mindfulness practices and mindful eating may reduce stress-related binge eating and comfort eating, according to  one review . Regular sleep, social contact, and time spent relaxing can also help tackle stress.  The brain is a major player in deciding what and when a person eats. If a person pays attention to the food they are eating instead of watching TV during a meal, they may consume less.  Research published in the journal   Appetite   found that eating a huge meal in the dark led people to consume 36 percent more. Paying attention to food during meals can help a person reduce overeating.   Another article  showed that mindfulness might reduce binge eating and comfort eating, which are two significant factors that influence  obesity .  The  National Institute of Health  recommend using mind and body-based techniques, such as meditation and  yoga , to curb appetite.  Certain foods are better for suppressing appetite than others, including:  Restricting food consumption too much can lead to a relapse of overeating. Instead, eating a good amount of the right foods can reduce hunger and food cravings throughout the day.  A person can suppress their appetite by including more protein, fat, and fiber in their meals. Stocking up on vegetables and pulses can make a person feel fuller for longer.  It might also help to try different spices, such as ginger and cayenne pepper, and drink tea to beat unwanted food cravings.
