 Kidney pain usually appears in the back, on either side of the spine, just under the ribs. A person who experiences this type of pain, especially if it intensifies over hours or days, may have a serious illness and should speak to a doctor.  In this article, learn more about the causes of kidney pain and how they might be related to drinking alcohol.  Moderate alcohol consumption should not cause kidney pain. However, excess alcohol consumption may injure the kidneys or increase the risk of  chronic kidney disease .  Kidney pain after drinking alcohol may be a sign of these conditions.  Binge drinking, or drinking numerous drinks in just a few hours, can cause an  acute kidney injury .  An acute kidney injury can occur when  waste accumulates in the blood  at a faster rate than the kidneys can filter it out.  In addition to kidney pain, a person with an acute kidney injury may also notice the following symptoms:  Without treatment, a person with an acute kidney injury may have a seizure or go into a  coma .  Alcohol may indirectly increase the risk of developing a  urinary tract infection  (UTI). UTIs that spread to the bladder may cause kidney pain.  Alcohol increases the acidity of urine and can irritate the lining of the bladder. A person who drinks alcohol can become dehydrated, increasing the risk of a UTI.  In addition to kidney pain, some  symptoms of a UTI include :  Over time, drinking may also  increase the risk  of kidney disease by forcing the kidneys to work harder and damaging the liver.  Over time, drinking too much can cause kidney pain and other symptoms of kidney dysfunction, such as  high blood pressure .  Chronic kidney disease is a serious and potentially life threatening condition that requires ongoing treatment. Some people with kidney disease may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.  Drinking does not cause all types of kidney pain. The timing of the pain could be a coincidence, or the alcohol could have intensified an existing problem.   Kidney stones  are another possible cause of pain. A person may feel intense back pain or pain in their genitals or stomach as the body attempts to pass the stone. Some people also develop a fever. If the body does not pass the stone, a person can develop a severe infection or blockage.  Sustaining a physical injury to the kidneys, such as by falling from a height, may also cause kidney pain.  It is important to see a doctor for any and all kidney pain, whether it is related to alcohol consumption or not.  A person is at risk of different complications depending on the underlying cause of the kidney pain.  For example, a person with a UTI that spreads to the kidneys can develop  sepsis , a dangerous infection of the blood.  The possible complications of uncontrolled or untreated kidney disease include:  The kidneys are the body's primary tool for filtering out dangerous substances, so issues affecting the kidneys can quickly affect the rest of the body, potentially causing problems in multiple organs.

Some strategies that can improve kidney health and reduce the risk of kidney disease include:  Not all forms of kidney disease are preventable, but adopting a healthful lifestyle may reduce the risk of complications, even in people with genetic kidney disorders.  Kidney pain can be intense. It is the body's way of warning of a potentially serious medical condition, so it is best not to ignore it.  Seeing a doctor as soon as possible helps ensure appropriate treatment and can reduce the risk of complications.
