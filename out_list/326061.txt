Suicidal thoughts and behavior   Epidiolex and other anti-epilepsy medications can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Other medications used to treat epilepsy (anti-epilepsy drugs) also increase this risk.  An  analysis  by the FDA looked at several studies done in people using anti-epilepsy drugs. Eleven different drugs were studied.  This analysis found that people treated for epilepsy had an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. The risk in people taking anti-epilepsy drugs was 80% higher than the risk in people who were not taking these drugs. The risk was increased after just one week of taking the medications.  These studies were done before Epidiolex became available. It's not known for sure how often people taking Epidiolex have suicidal thoughts or behavior.  During treatment with Epidiolex, your doctor will monitor you or your child closely for signs of new or worsening  depression  or unusual mood changes.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs such as Epidiolex to treat certain conditions. Epidiolex may also be used off-label for other conditions. Off-label use is when a drug that's approved to treat one condition is used to treat a different condition.  Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two rare and severe forms of epilepsy:  These syndromes can be very difficult to treat. People with these forms of epilepsy often need more than one medication to reduce the number of seizures they have.  Epidiolex is approved for use in adults and children ages 2 and older with these conditions.  Epidiolex is the first FDA-approved drug made with cannabidiol (CBD). It's only approved to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  Many studies are looking at other ways CBD could be used for medical treatment. Some of these possible uses are described below.   Epidiolex for pain   Epidiolex isn't approved to treat pain.  Animal studies  have shown that CBD may help relieve pain. However, fewer studies have looked at the safety and effectiveness of CBD for treating pain in humans. For more information, see the "Epidiolex for treating pain" section below.   Epidiolex for anxiety   Epidiolex isn't approved to treat  anxiety . However,  several studies  have shown that CBD may improve anxiety by reducing anxious feelings during stressful times.

Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor.   Epidiolex for migraine   Epidiolex is not approved to treat or prevent  migraine . Few studies have looked at the use of CBD for migraine treatment.  In some  clinical studies , CBD helped to reduce the number of migraine  headaches  in people using the drug. In these studies, CBD was used in combination with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  Similar to CBD, THC is a compound that comes from marijuana. THC can cause you to feel "high" or euphoric. These effects aren't caused by CBD.  Epidiolex hasn't been proven safe or effective for treating migraine. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor.   Epidiolex for infantile spasms   Epidiolex isn't approved to treat infantile spasms. Only one small  clinical study  looked at using CBD to treat this condition. For almost all of the infants in the study, CBD didn't improve their symptoms.  Epidiolex hasn't been proven safe or effective for treating infantile spasms. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor.   Epidiolex for tuberous sclerosis   Epidiolex isn't approved to treat tuberous sclerosis. However, in one small  clinical study , the following results were seen in people with this condition:  People in this study taking CBD in combination with a seizure drug called clobazam had even fewer seizures during treatment.  Epidiolex hasn't been proven safe or effective for treating tuberous sclerosis. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor.   Epidiolex for multiple sclerosis   Epidiolex isn't approved to treat  multiple sclerosis  (MS). There isn't much known about using CBD alone to treat MS.  Several studies have looked at using a combination of CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to treat MS. Similar to CBD, THC comes from marijuana. However, THC can cause you to feel "high" or euphoric.

Symptoms that improved included:  Epidiolex hasn't been proven safe or effective for treating MS. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor.  Epidiolex is FDA-approved for use in children to treat seizures caused by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It can be given to children ages 2 years and older.  Epidiolex isn't FDA-approved to treat pain. Epidiolex is made from cannabidiol (CBD). This compound is a drug that comes from marijuana (cannabis). CBD has been studied as a treatment for pain in both animals and humans.  The exact way that CBD reduces pain isn't known. It's thought that CBD blocks certain pain signals traveling through the body's nerves. This may help to reduce the pain you actually feel. CBD also helps to stop  inflammation  that can happen after nerves are irritated by pain.  Several  animal studies  have looked at using CBD to treat pain. In these studies, CBD reduced pain in animals that had nerve pain caused by  chemotherapy  (a type of  cancer  treatment) or joint pain caused by  arthritis .  One small  study  looked at using CBD to treat people with pain caused by nerve disease or nerve damage. People in this study were given either CBD, THC (a drug that also comes from cannabis), CBD together with THC, or a  placebo  (no treatment). The results showed the following:   Many other studies  have found that the combination of CBD and THC helps to reduce pain caused by some diseases and injuries. More research is needed to know if CBD treatment alone reduces pain.  Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. These rare but severe conditions usually appear in early childhood or infancy.  Before Epidiolex was approved, it was tested in clinical trials. Its active ingredient, cannabidiol, is currently being tested in clinical trials for other uses.  In  clinical trials , people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who were treated with Epidiolex had fewer seizures than people who did not take the drug. During the 14-week study:  Another  clinical trial  lasting 14 weeks looked at people with Dravet syndrome. This trial included children and teenagers. People who took Epidiolex had 26% fewer seizures than people who did not take the drug. The dosage of Epidiolex given in this trial was 20 mg/kg daily.  All of the people in both of these clinical trials were taking Epidiolex in combination with other epilepsy drugs. Examples of epilepsy medications given include:  Cannabidiol (the active drug in Epidiolex) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a treatment option for other conditions. Research is being done for the following conditions:  Many ongoing studies for other conditions are also being done. If you'd like to participate in a study, look for clinical trials in your area at  clinicaltrials.gov .  Other drugs are available that can treat your condition. Some may be better suited for you than others. If you're interested in finding an alternative to Epidiolex, talk to your doctor to learn more about other medications that may work well for you.   Note : Some of the drugs listed here are used off-label to treat these specific conditions.   Treatment guidelines  recommend the following drugs to treat Lennox-Gastaut syndrome:  Some  experts  recommend the following drugs to treat Dravet syndrome:  Epidiolex is commonly prescribed with other drugs when used to treat seizures.

Because Epidiolex has been approved by the FDA, you can be assured that the drug:  Other products made with CBD are available to purchase, but they haven't been approved by the FDA. This means that the FDA can't guarantee that those products have a safe amount of CBD. It also means the effectiveness of those products hasn't been tested.  One  study  looked at products containing CBD that were not FDA-approved. The study found that only 31% of those products contained the amount of CBD listed on their label. Of the remaining 69% of products:  The labels for these products didn't state that they contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, about 21% of the products did contain THC. This chemical is found in marijuana (cannabis). THC can make you feel "high" or euphoric.  Certain U.S. states have laws that require products containing CBD to be tested before they're sold. States that haven't made marijuana (cannabis) legal for medical or recreational use don't have these laws. This means that products containing CBD might not be tested before they're sold in some areas of the United States.  Be sure you're familiar with state laws before you purchase any products containing CBD. This will help you make sure that you buy products from safe and reputable companies that have had their products tested.  You may wonder how Epidiolex compares to other products made from cannabis.

This means that Epidiolex has a low risk of being misused.  Epidiolex is the only FDA-approved medication made from CBD. All other drugs made with CBD are classified as  schedule one (I)  drugs. They're not approved by the FDA for medical treatment. However, in some U.S. states, it's legal to use these products for medical use.  If you travel to other U.S. states and use Epidiolex, it helps to be familiar with the legal status of CBD in those states. Epidiolex is legal for use in all states if you have a prescription for it. However, CBD products other than Epidiolex are illegal in many states.  The U.S. government has special rules in place for all controlled substances. These rules help ensure safety when controlled drugs are prescribed and dispensed. If you'd like to know more about how controlled substances are handled, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.  All controlled substances, including Epidiolex, need to be stored in a safe, secure place. Carefully storing this drug will help prevent it from being used accidentally by other people (or pets). It will also help prevent anyone from trying to misuse the drug.  Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about Epidiolex.  Epidiolex is classified as a  schedule five (V)  prescription drug. Drugs with a higher classification (such as schedule five drugs) have a lower risk of being misused than drugs with a lower classification (such as schedule one drugs). This means that Epidiolex has a low risk of being misused.  Epidiolex is the only FDA-approved medication made from cannabidiol (CBD). The quality, safety, and effectiveness of a drug can be ensured by FDA-approval. Because Epidiolex has been approved by the FDA, you can be assured that the drug:  All other drugs made with CBD are classified as  schedule one (I)  drugs. These drugs are not approved by the federal government for medical treatment. However, in some U.S. states, it's legal to use these products for medical use.  No, Epidiolex doesn't make you feel "high" or euphoric.  Epidiolex contains a drug called cannabidiol (CBD). This drug comes from marijuana (cannabis). It doesn't make you feel intoxicated. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a drug that also comes from marijuana (cannabis). THC can make you feel "high."  Epidiolex doesn't contain any THC. It only contains CBD.  Yes, it's legal to use Epidiolex if your doctor has prescribed it for you or your child. Epidiolex is an FDA-approved drug, just like any other medication that your doctor prescribes.  Yes, you can use Epidiolex if you're on a ketogenic diet. But you should talk with your doctor about how your diet can affect the medication. Eating meals high in fat can increase the amount of Epidiolex that your body absorbs. This can increase the level of Epidiolex in your system.  In  clinical studies , Epidiolex levels were increased up to five times when the drug was taken with a high-fat meal.  Higher levels of Epidiolex in the body can increase your risk of side effects. These can include:  If you're on a ketogenic diet, your doctor will monitor your side effects. They may recommend a different dose of Epidiolex or changes in your diet.  In total, 1,756 people took Epidiolex during  clinical studies . About 1% of people in the clinical studies died.  Epidiolex was not found to be the cause of death in these people. Many of those who died had several complicated diseases. Some of these diseases increase the risk of death.  Also, the number of deaths in these studies was similar to the number of deaths in people who have either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome.  Before taking Epidiolex, talk with your doctor about any medical conditions you have. Epidiolex may not be right for you if you have certain conditions. These include:  Taking too much Epidiolex can increase your risk of serious side effects.  Symptoms of an overdose can include:  If you think you've taken too much of this drug, call your doctor or seek guidance from the American Association of Poison Control Centers at 800-222-1222 or through their  online tool .  If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right away .  When you get Epidiolex from the pharmacy, the pharmacist will add an expiration date to the label on the bottle. This date is typically one year from the date they dispensed the medication.  The expiration date helps guarantee the effectiveness of the medication during this time. The  current stance  of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to avoid using expired medications. If you have unused medication that has gone past the expiration date, talk to your pharmacist about whether you might still be able to use it.  How long a medication remains good can depend on many factors, including how and where you store the medication.  Epidiolex solution should be stored at room temperature. Make sure to keep the bottle standing upright and the lid tightly closed. Do not freeze the medication.  You can use Epidiolex for 12 weeks (three months) after the bottle is first opened. Discard any medication that's left over after the bottle has been open for 12 weeks.  If you no longer need to take Epidiolex and have leftover medication, it's important to dispose of it safely. This helps prevent others, including children and pets, from taking the drug by accident. It also helps keep the drug from harming the environment.  The  FDA website  provides several useful tips on medication disposal. You can also ask your pharmacist for information on how to dispose of your medication.  The following information is provided for clinicians and other healthcare professionals.  Epidiolex (cannabidiol) is FDA-approved for the following indications:  It is approved for use in people ages 2 years and older.  The mechanism of action of Epidiolex in treating epilepsy is not clear. However, it appears that the anticonvulsant activity of Epidiolex is not related to interaction with cannabinoid receptors in the body.  At steady state, Epidiolex reaches maximum concentration in 2.5 to 5 hours. High-calorie or high-fat meals increase maximum concentration 5-fold, compared to concentration after administration in a fasted state.  Protein binding of the parent drug and metabolites is greater than 94%.  Epidiolex is extensively metabolized by the liver. Metabolism occurs via CYP2C19, CYP3A4, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment increases blood plasma levels 2.5-fold to 5.2-fold.  The half-life of Epidiolex is between 56 and 61 hours. Elimination occurs primarily in the feces, with significantly less excretion in the urine.  Epidiolex is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cannabidiol or any of the components of Epidiolex.  Epidiolex is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sesame seed oil.  Epidiolex is classified by the federal government as a schedule five (V) drug, which has the lowest abuse and  addiction  potential compared to other drug schedules.  In  clinical studies , there were no reports of abuse or dependence.  As with all anti-epileptic drugs, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided due to potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. Gradual titration is recommended.  Store Epidiolex in an upright position and at room temperature (68°F to 78°F, or 20°C to 25.6°C) with the cap tightly closed. Do not freeze. Discard any unused solution 12 weeks after first opening.
