 Researchers have looked at other herbal and natural remedies as treatment options, but have not yet found that any of them are consistently effective.  Recently, there has been much interest in cannabidiol (CBD). In June 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved the use  of a specific cannabidiol CBD product to treat two specific types of  epilepsy .  Research has suggested that CBD may have other health benefits, ranging from relieving pain to treating  depression  and  anxiety , and possibly also reducing the symptoms of  menopause .  CBD is one of many substances that occur in cannabis. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), another cannabinoid, CBD is not psychoactive. This means that it does not cause the "high" that people typically associate with marijuana.  Cannabis is often called hemp or marijuana, depending on the THC content.  Marijuana derived CBD products are currently  illegal on the federal level , but they are legal under some state laws. Hemp derived CBD products containing less than 0.3% THC are legal on the federal level, but they remain illegal under some state laws.  People should check their state's laws and those of anywhere they intend to travel. Also, remember that nonprescription CBD products do not have FDA approval. Labeling may not be fully inaccurate.  CBD may work on the body in a range of ways to help menopause symptoms. Of particular interest is the way that it interacts with cannabinoid receptors.  The endocannabinoid system refers to a collection of cell receptors, called cannabinoid receptors, which are present in the brain, organs, and other tissues throughout the body.  The endocannabinoid system works by interacting with chemical messengers, including CBD.  Researchers believe that this system plays an essential role in many bodily functions and other aspects of health, including:  One theory is that a poorly functioning endocannabinoid system can lead to several different health conditions. Manipulating the chemicals involved in the system, such as CBD, could potentially help to treat such conditions.  Menopause seems to disrupt the endocannabinoid system, and there are cannabinoid receptors throughout the female reproductive system, so it is possible that CBD oil could reduce some of the symptoms relating to menopause.  While there is no evidence indicating that CBD oil is likely to influence all menopause symptoms, it could be helpful for the following:  One of the most common symptoms of menopause is mood changes.  A  2010 study in mice  found that CBD operates in a similar way to  antidepressant  medications in the brain, and reduces symptoms of depression.  It may be that CBD could also help to stabilize mood in humans.  Being unable to sleep properly is a common complaint during menopause, and it can have a significant impact on daily life.  A  2016 case study  on a person with  post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) showed that CBD oil was able to reduce sleep disturbances and anxiety.  It is possible that CBD oil may also be useful in treating the sleep disturbances relating to menopause.  A low bone density can increase the chance of  fractures  or bruises, so it is an important symptom to treat.  Some  research has found  that CBD interacts with a cannabinoid receptor that may play a role in bone density loss. CBD may, therefore, be able to reduce the rate of bone density loss that can occur during menopause.  At present, there is very little reliable evidence to suggest that CBD oil can treat the symptoms of menopause.  Researchers have only just started to understand how the endocannabinoid system works and the role it may play in different health conditions.  Future research in this area will be necessary to directly test theories relating to the role of CBD in menopause. It will then be possible to determine whether or not CBD oil could help to reduce menopause symptoms.  CBD is one of the active components found in hemp and marijuana. CBD has medicinal use but does not cause "high" associated with marijuana.  Anyone who is considering using CBD for menopause or other health issues should research the legal use of CBD and other products in their area first.
