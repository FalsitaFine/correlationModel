 While people tend to associate pallor with the face, it can also cause the nail beds to turn very light or white. The color change can likewise affect the lips, gums, and tongue.  When a person appears pale, it may be because there is not enough oxygen-rich hemoglobin near the skin's surface. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen, and several conditions can reduce hemoglobin levels.  Paleness is different from low levels of pigment in the skin.  Some  genetic conditions , such as  albinism  and  vitiligo , affect the skin's pigment. Pigmentation changes can also result from skin damage, such as from a burn or injury. In these cases, the body's melanocytes, the cells that give the skin its pigment, are involved.  Below, we describe the most common causes of skin paleness.   Anemia  refers to  a group of conditions  that prevent the blood from having enough healthy red cells. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen. Without enough hemoglobin and oxygen, the skin can turn pale.  Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type, and it involves a person not having enough iron. This can occur when the body is unable to absorb iron correctly or when bleeding depletes iron levels.  Some other types of anemia include:  Certain diseases, including  cancer , can cause anemia, and it can also develop after heavy bleeding.  A person with anemia may feel exhausted and experience shortness of breath. Anemia requires medical treatment; anyone who suspects that they have it should see a doctor.  Any type of excessive bleeding can deplete the body's iron stores and reduce hemoglobin levels, causing paleness.  Bleeding that is severe enough to cause paleness warrants immediate medical attention. If the person is still actively bleeding, their life is in danger and they must receive emergency assistance.  Some examples of bleeding that can cause paleness include:  Extreme malnourishment can make it difficult for the body to produce healthy blood cells.   Vitamin-deficiency anemia  can result when a person has insufficient levels of  vitamin  B-12, which is also called  folate . Anyone with this type of anemia may become very pale and exhausted.  A B-12 deficiency may occur when the gastrointestinal tract cannot absorb the vitamin correctly.  A doctor's blood test can reveal whether a person has vitamin deficiencies. While vitamin supplements may help, some nutritional deficiencies result from problems with absorption, rather than a lack in the diet. Anyone who suspects that they have a vitamin deficiency should see a doctor for a diagnosis.  A wide range of infections can cause pallor.  One of the most serious is  sepsis , a type of infection that can result from bacteria entering the bloodstream. If the bacteria damage red blood cells, it can cause a person to look pale. Sepsis is a medical emergency that usually requires a person to take  antibiotics  and stay in the hospital.  Paleness can also result from:   Fatigue  can cause a person to look pale. However, researchers have not yet identified the link. Authors of a  2013 study  noted that fatigue can also cause a person's eyes to be droopy and red.  In some cases, fatigue — especially chronic fatigue — is a symptom of an underlying condition, such as anemia.  Breathing disorders make it difficult for a person to get enough oxygen, and this can result in paleness. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and  lung cancer  are two examples of these conditions.  Acute breathing issues, such as those caused by an  asthma  attack or  anaphylactic shock , can also deplete blood oxygen levels. In addition, some people develop a blue tinge to their skin called  cyanosis .  Breathing difficulties that are severe enough to cause paleness indicate that a person is not getting enough oxygen. It is important for people taking oxygen therapy to use it as their doctor has prescribed.  Anyone experiencing an episode of acute breathing difficulty should receive medical attention.  Some rare genetic disorders affect red blood cells — or hemoglobin in particular — and cause chronic paleness. Usually, a person will be pale for their whole life.  One such condition is  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) . This disorder almost always develops in males, and it causes red blood cells to break down prematurely, leading to hemolytic anemia. A person may be very pale, with yellowing around the eyes.  Many people with G6PD have specific triggers, including eating fava beans. Removing the trigger often treats the condition.  Certain cancers can cause paleness. For example, lung cancer can restrict a person's ability to breathe and lead to oxygen deprivation.  Also,  leukemia  affects the body's ability to produce red blood cells, causing paleness and reducing blood oxygen levels.  When paleness is the only symptom that a person has, an urgent trip to the doctor is usually not necessary. If the pallor does not go away or it becomes worse, see a doctor within a few days.  Contact a doctor when paleness occurs with:  Seek emergency medical attention when paleness occurs:  A person with any skin tone can grow pale when they have too little hemoglobin or oxygen in their body.  Paleness can sometimes be a symptom of a severe health issue. However, almost all causes of pallor are fully treatable, especially with prompt care.  See a doctor for unexplained paleness, especially when there are accompanying symptoms.
