 The anus is at the end of the rectum, and muscle surrounds it. Depending on the cause of the swelling, people may have additional symptoms, such as pain, itching, burning, or bleeding around the anus.  In this article, we discuss the possible causes of a swollen anus and explain how doctors diagnose and treat these conditions.  An  anal fissure  is a small rip or tear that occurs in the lining of the anus.  Damage to the lining of the anus or overstretching it, possibly during a bowel movement, can cause an anal fissure. An anal fissure is most common when a person has either a dry, hard bowel movement or frequent, loose stool.  Less commonly, an infection or  tumor  can cause an anal fissure.  Other symptoms of an anal fissure include:  A  perianal abscess  is a collection of fluid that gathers in the glands near the anus. In most cases, the abscess arises as a result of an infection.  A person might notice fluid or drainage coming from a perianal abscess.  Other symptoms  include  fever , pain, and problems urinating.   Hemorrhoids  are a common cause of anal swelling.  Hemorrhoids are swollen veins that occur in the anus and lower rectum. They can be external, appearing around the skin of the anus, or internal, which means that they arise in the lining of the anus or rectum.  Hemorrhoids are more common in older people and those who eat low fiber diets, strain during bowel movements, and have chronic  constipation . They are also more likely to occur during pregnancy.  Other symptoms include:   Anusitis  is a disorder that involves  inflammation  of the anal canal. People often mistake anusitis for hemorrhoids.  Inflammatory bowel disease, infections, and chronic  diarrhea  can cause anusitis. However, the most common cause is a diet that contains a lot of acidic or spicy foods, such as  coffee , citrus, and spices.  Other symptoms of anusitis include:  An anal fistula is a large tear or tunnel that develops under the skin and connects the end of the bowel to either the anus or an abscess.  According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, an anal fistula will occur in about  50%  of people with an abscess.  People with an anal fistula might experience:   Crohn's disease  is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, including the anus.   Perianal Crohn's disease  signifies more severe disease, and it can be challenging to manage.  Symptoms include:  Anal symptoms can sometimes be due to  anal cancer , although this disease is quite rare.  Anal cancer is less common than  colon cancer  or rectal  cancer . The American Cancer Society estimate that there will be  about 8,300  new cases of anal cancer in 2019 in the United States.  The symptoms can be similar to those of other anal disorders and include:  Friction from sexual activity involving the anus can irritate the sensitive tissues around it, causing swelling, small tears, or bleeding.  Anal sex is mostly safe, but because there is a risk of bacterial infections, people should consider the risks.  Learn about how to practice anal sex safely here .  A doctor will typically begin the diagnostic assessment by taking a thorough medical history and carrying out a physical examination.  Sometimes, a doctor can diagnose an anal disorder upon visual inspection or with a digital exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into the anal canal.  However, they will investigate internal problems using other tests, which might include:  The underlying cause of a swollen anus will determine the treatment.  At-home treatment options for an anal fissure  include :  Chronic anal fissures might require surgical repair.  Sometimes, injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the anal sphincter help heal chronic anal fissures.  Perianal abscesses often require surgical drainage, particularly in people with weakened immune systems and those with  diabetes . After surgical drainage, the wound can take  3â€“4 weeks  to heal.  Treatments for hemorrhoids  include :  Prolapsed or internal hemorrhoids may require medical treatment, including laser procedures or surgery.  The type of treatment for anusitis  will depend  on the underlying cause. If the cause is inflammatory bowel disease or an infection, a person will need medical treatment.  Other treatments include:  Surgery is  almost always  necessary to treat an anal fistula.  The treatment of perianal Crohn's disease is  often multifactorial  and may include:  When deciding how to treat anal cancer, doctors will consider  several factors , including the type of tumor and how far it has spread into the body. They will also take into account a person's age and overall health.  A treatment plan for anal cancer might consist of a combination of  chemotherapy , radiation, and surgery.  A swollen anus may be very uncomfortable, but in most cases, the causes are temporary and pose no long term risk.  Home remedies for anal swelling include warm baths, a high fiber diet, hydration, and topical medications.  A person should contact their doctor if they experience persistent symptoms, such as pain, bleeding, or changes in bowel habits.
