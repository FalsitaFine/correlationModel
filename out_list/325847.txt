 Changes in  estrogen  levels are often the cause of this type of bleeding, and light spotting around  ovulation  does not usually signal a serious problem. Some people refer to ovulation bleeding as "estrogen breakthrough bleeding."  In this article, learn more about ovulation bleeding and other types of bleeding between periods. We also explain when to see a doctor.  Ovulation bleeding generally refers to bleeding that occurs around the time of ovulation, which is when the ovary releases an egg.  In the days leading up to ovulation, estrogen levels steadily rise. After the release of an egg, the estrogen levels dip, and  progesterone  levels begin to increase.  This shift in the balance between estrogen and progesterone levels can cause light bleeding, which is usually much lighter than a regular period.  In most cases, it does not cause any other symptoms.  If a person experiences other symptoms, such as cramping, alongside the bleeding or it lasts longer than a few days, something other than ovulation bleeding may be the underlying cause.  People who do not regularly ovulate may have unusual bleeding patterns, such as bleeding very lightly for many days or only getting a period every few months. Numerous medical conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and  endometriosis , can cause irregular cycles.  Ovulation bleeding is just one of many types of atypical vaginal bleeding. While bleeding that relates to ovulation is usually harmless, it is important to ensure that there is no underlying medical cause.  Some hallmarks of bleeding during ovulation include:  Bleeding that does not follow this pattern could be due to:  In people with very irregular cycles, it can be difficult to tell the difference between irregular bleeding and the normal monthly period. Anyone whose periods do not follow a predictable pattern should talk to a doctor.  Light spotting in the middle of the cycle is not usually harmful, especially if it occurs at the same time each month.  However, it is important to discuss any unusual bleeding with a doctor, particularly if other symptoms occur alongside it. Charting the bleeding — including what time it usually occurs and how long it lasts — can help a doctor identify the cause.  People who experience the following should speak to a doctor:  A person should seek urgent medical attention if:  Bleeding between periods is common, affecting  9–14%  of females between menarche — when periods begin — and menopause.  While ovulation bleeding is a common reason for bleeding between periods, it is not the only potential cause. Therefore, it is important to monitor the bleeding and talk to a doctor about any bothersome symptoms.  As everyone's menstrual cycle can be different, a person may wish to track their cycle to determine the usual cycle length and the typical day of ovulation. This information can often help a doctor determine whether ovulation or something else is causing the bleeding.
