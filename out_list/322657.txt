The primary safety concern is that the steam could burn the sensitive vaginal tissues if it is too hot.  Adding extra moist heat to the vagina and exposing the vagina to certain additives within the steam could also increase a woman's risk for yeast or bacterial infections.  If the vaginal steaming equipment is not kept clean, a person could also be at risk for infections and other side effects.

Women who are trying to restore pH balance to their vagina due to frequent infections should see their doctor before they try vaginal steaming.  There are prescription treatments available to help restore pH balance. These are more likely to be effective than vaginal steaming.

Keeping the vagina clean, dry, and free of perfumes is the best way to keep the vagina healthy. Therefore, most people should not try vaginal steaming.  If they do try it, it is best to exercise extreme caution to reduce the risk of burns and infections.
