  About 1 in 1,000 children  develop some form of  arthritis . Juvenile  rheumatoid arthritis  is the most common type of arthritis among children.  Most doctors now call the condition  juvenile idiopathic arthritis , or JIA. A condition is idiopathic when its cause is unknown. While doctors think that JIA is an autoimmune condition, meaning that it happens when the body attacks healthy tissue, they do not know why some children get it.  In this article, learn about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of JIA. We also cover the long-term outlook for people with this condition.  The symptoms of JIA vary depending on its subtype.  However, the most common symptoms include:  Doctors classify JIA into  several subtypes  depending on how many and which joints the disease affects, the severity of the symptoms, and which antibodies the immune system produces.  The types of JIA are:  Most research suggests that JIA is an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system initiates an attack on healthy tissue as if it were an infection. In JIA, the immune system attacks the tissue of the joints.  A combination of genetics and environmental factors may determine who develops JIA. Children with JIA may carry genes that predispose them to the condition, then develop symptoms following a triggering event, such as a virus or injury.   A 2016 analysis  found that children with allergies are more likely to develop JIA. Allergies might somehow trigger the activation of genes for arthritis, or the genes that predispose children to arthritis might be similar to those that cause allergies.  Some types of JIA are more likely to affect children at certain ages. The primary difference between juvenile and adult arthritis is that  juvenile arthritis sometimes disappears on its own  or gets better in adulthood.  Juvenile arthritis is neither contagious nor currently preventable.  Doctors cannot use any single test to diagnose JIA. Instead, they use a combination of symptoms and tests to confirm a diagnosis.  To help them make an accurate diagnosis, a doctor may:  Many treatment strategies can help reduce the symptoms of JIA. These include:  Some people also try using alternative or complementary remedies, such as  acupuncture . To get the best results, use these alternative therapies only with the approval of a doctor and never as a replacement for medical treatment.  It is crucial to tell a doctor about any side effects of treatment. Some children have to try several combinations of treatments before something works.  Doctors do not know how to cure juvenile arthritis. However, many children with this disease go into remission, which means that they stop having symptoms. It is possible for symptoms to return even after remission.  Remission estimates vary.  A 2014 study  that followed children with JIA for 30 years found that 59% were in remission without medication at the 30 year mark. A total of 7% were in remission with medication, while 34% still had active JIA.  There is no way to predict who will and who will not get better. With comprehensive and sensitive medical care, however, most children can find treatments that manage their symptoms and allow them to lead a full and comfortable life. Many will find that arthritis does not affect them when they reach adulthood.
