 Doctors may refer to the tingling sensations as paresthesia.  Here we look at possible causes, diagnosis, and treatment options.  There are several possible causes of tingling in the face, including the following:  Certain medications can affect nerve function. Although the symptoms will usually resolve once a person stops taking the medication, nerve damage may be permanent in rare cases.  People undergoing treatment for  HIV , AIDs, or  cancer  may be more at risk of experiencing tingling in the face due to their medications. Other medications that can affect nerve function include:  Nerve-related side effects of medications may include:   Bell's palsy  is a type of cranial  neuropathy  that results from the  inflammation  of a nerve in the face. It causes temporary paralysis to one side of the face.  People may notice the following symptoms in the face:  Bell's palsy can affect anyone, but it is  more common  in people between the ages of 15 and 60 years. It affects about  40,000  people in the United States each year.  People with  diabetes  or upper respiratory conditions, such as the  flu , have a higher risk of getting Bell's palsy.   Multiple sclerosis  (MS) is a condition that affects the  central nervous system . Tingling and numbness in the face are among the possible symptoms of MS. People may also experience these sensations in other parts of the body, such as the hands or feet.  The symptoms of MS can vary from person to person but may include:  Risk factors for developing MS include both genetic and environmental factors.  People can develop  shingles  if they have had  chickenpox  in the past, and the virus reactivates after lying dormant in the body. Shingles usually affects a small area on one side of the face or body. Symptoms include:  People who are more at risk of getting shingles include older adults and those with a weakened immune system.  Tingling or numbness in the face can be a symptom of a  stroke . The acronym  FAST  can help people identify the warning signs of a stroke quickly:   F ace: One side of the face is drooping, and smiling becomes lopsided   A rms: Weakness in the arms, and inability to keep them raised above the head   S peech: Difficult to understand or slurred speech   T ime to call 911: Seek emergency medical help, even if the symptoms go away  Irritation of the trigeminal nerve can lead to  trigeminal neuralgia , a condition that causes intense pain in the face. People may experience a stabbing or electric shock sensation on one side of their face.  People may feel tingling in the face before experiencing frequent bursts of pain. Medications can help a person manage the condition.   Hemiplegic migraine  is a rare type of  migraine  that causes one side of the face or body to become weak. It can also cause tingling or numbness in the face. Other symptoms include:  Nerve damage, also called neuropathy, can happen as a result of illness or injury.  People are at a higher risk of getting nerve damage if they have the following conditions:  Genetics can also contribute to a person's risk of nerve damage.  Focal neuropathy affects a single nerve, and people may notice symptoms in one area of the body, such as the face. Symptoms can include:  Although it is rare, people with  epilepsy  sometimes experience tingling or numbness in the face or other parts of the body during a partial seizure.  Symptoms can also include:  Tingling in the face can also be due to other conditions, such as:  A doctor may diagnose the cause of face tingling by carrying out a physical examination, which will typically include reflex, sensation, and balance tests. They may also use medical tests to help them diagnose the underlying condition that is causing the tingling.  Tests may include:  If people are experiencing tingling in the face for unknown reasons, or their symptoms do not pass, they should see a doctor.  Anyone who notices signs of a stroke or has any severe symptoms should seek emergency medical help or call 911 or their local emergency number.  Treatment will vary depending on the condition causing face tingling. Stress can increase pain levels in certain conditions, so reducing stress and focusing on relaxation can help the body recover.  If people have a skin condition such as shingles, applying a cool compress can help soothe the pain. Taking an oatmeal bath or using calamine lotion may also help.  People with Bell's palsy can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen. Wearing an eye patch and using eye drops can also help protect the affected eye.  A team of healthcare professionals can work alongside people with MS to create a treatment program to help manage the condition.  People with epilepsy can help lower the likelihood of seizures by ensuring that they get enough sleep.  Maintaining a healthful lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise can help reduce the risk of diabetes,  high blood pressure , and other health conditions that can lead to nerve damage and other complications.  Reducing stress and taking time to relax may also help minimize the risk of certain conditions that can cause tingling in the face.  Tingling in the face can often be a temporary sensation due to short term conditions. People may be able to recover from the condition with at-home treatments and plenty of rest.  In some cases, tingling in the face may be a symptom of an underlying condition that will require further treatment.
