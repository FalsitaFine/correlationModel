 The right upper quadrant (RUQ) includes the pancreas, right kidney, gallbladder, liver, and intestines.  Pain under the ribs in this area can indicate a health problem affecting one of these organs or the surrounding tissues.  Below, we describe nine causes of pain in the RUQ, their treatments, and when to see a doctor.  RUQ pain can result from gastrointestinal issues, such as  indigestion  or gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ).  Symptoms of GERD can include:  Maintaining a healthful lifestyle, avoiding trigger foods, and taking antacid medications can often help with managing GERD.  An infection in the right kidney can cause pain in the RUQ. Other symptoms of a  kidney infection  can include:  Bacteria or a virus may be responsible for this infection, and it can spread from the bladder.  Anyone who suspects that they have a kidney infection should see a doctor right away. They may receive a prescription for  antibiotics .  If the infection is severe, a person may need to stay in the hospital to receive intravenous fluids and, possibly, further treatment.  When a  kidney stone  forms in the right kidney, it can cause pain in the RUQ. Other symptoms of kidney stones can include:  If a person suspects that pain results from kidney stones, or if they have other symptoms of the condition, they should see a doctor right away.  Treatment may involve removing the stone or breaking it into pieces that the body can pass easily.  The gallbladder sits in the RUQ underneath the liver.  Gallstones  are small and made up of  cholesterol  or bilirubin, which is a substance that forms when red blood cells break down.  The primary risk factor for gallstones is being overweight, particularly if the weight is around the waist.  Gallstones can cause:  If a person experiences any of these symptoms, they should see a doctor right away. If left untreated, gallstones can block the bile ducts and cause complications.  One treatment for gallstones involves removing the gallbladder, which is not an essential organ.  A liver abscess, which doctors also call a hepatic abscess or pyogenic liver abscess, is a collection of  pus  in the liver. The pus can result from infection with parasites, bacteria, or fungi.  A liver abscess can cause pain or tenderness in the RUQ, as well as:  Treatment typically involves a procedure to drain the pus. If the infection is bacterial, antibiotics can often help fight off the infection.  Pain in the RUQ can stem from other liver conditions, such as  cirrhosis , fatty liver, and  liver cancer .  Symptoms to look out for include:  If a person notices any of these symptoms, they should see a doctor.   Preeclampsia  is a complication that develops in  5â€“8%  of pregnancies. It tends to arise anytime between 20 weeks of gestation and 6 weeks after delivery.  Preeclampsia results from a sudden rise in  blood pressure , and it causes swelling, mostly in the face, hands, and feet.  Other symptoms can include:  A doctor needs to monitor blood pressure with regular prenatal checkups.  High blood pressure  can indicate preeclampsia, even when no other symptoms are present.  A woman with any symptom of preeclampsia should receive immediate medical attention because the condition can become serious if it remains untreated. Treatment usually involves taking medication.  A pancreas condition can cause pain under the ribs in the middle of the abdomen, in the RUQ, or the left upper quadrant (LUQ).   Pancreatitis  is  inflammation  of the pancreas, and it may result from gallstones or overuse of alcohol.  Symptoms of pancreatitis include:  If a person has symptoms of pancreatitis, they should see a doctor right away because the condition can be severe.  Mild pancreatitis may go away within a few weeks. However, if pancreatitis becomes severe, a person may require medication and intravenous fluids in the hospital.  Lung conditions, such as  pneumonia , can cause pain that spreads to the right side of the chest under the ribs.  Other conditions in surrounding areas can also cause pain in the RUQ. Some include:  People with mild or reoccurring RUQ pain should see a doctor and discuss any other symptoms.  If a person experiences any of the following symptoms, they should see a doctor right away:  Also, seek immediate medical attention for any symptoms of preeclampsia or a kidney infection. These conditions can be dangerous if a person does not receive treatment.  Pain under the ribs in the RUQ can result from various conditions that affect the organs or surrounding tissues in that area of the abdomen.  These conditions may relate to the liver or right kidney, for example, or they may be gastrointestinal.  Anyone with consistent or severe pain in the right side of the abdomen should seek immediate medical attention.
