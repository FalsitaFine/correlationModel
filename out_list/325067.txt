  Vitamin  C, also called ascorbic acid, plays many important roles in the body. In particular, it is key to the immune system, helping prevent infections and fight disease.  The human body does not store vitamin C, so people need to get this nutrient from their diet every day. It dissolves in water, and any excess leaves the body in urine.  This article looks at the foods richest in vitamin C and how to include them in the diet. It also discusses the vitamin's function and health benefits.  According to the  Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) , the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C for adults is:  Some experts believe that people should consume much more than the recommended daily allowance for good health.  One scientific editorial  suggests that 200 mg per day is an optimal amount for most adults.  One serving of any of the foods below contains more than 20 percent of the recommended daily value of vitamin C. This makes these foods  "excellent" sources  of the vitamin, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The following 20 foods are among the richest sources of vitamin C:  Cooking may reduce the amount of the vitamin in fruits and vegetables. To lose the least vitamin C, the  ODS  recommend steaming or microwaving these foods.  To get the most vitamin C, eat a variety of raw fruits and vegetables every day.  Vitamin C is an  antioxidant . It protects the body's cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals can cause changes in cells and DNA that can lead to illnesses, including  cancer .  This vitamin also plays a key role in almost all of the body's tissues. Without vitamin C, the body cannot make  collagen , a protein that is necessary for building and maintaining:  Vitamin C is an important part of the immune system, which defends against viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.  Studies  show that low levels of vitamin C lead to problems with the immune system and other illnesses.  Vitamin C deficiency can result in a condition called  scurvy . This deficiency is  relatively rare  in the United States.  A vitamin C deficiency, or scurvy, may cause:  The following sections discuss some of the most important benefits of vitamin C.  Some evidence suggests that vitamin C may help lower the risk of  heart disease  or its complications.   One study  indicates that people who consume more vitamin C have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.  Other researchers are not convinced that vitamin C alone improves heart health. However, it is clear that eating more fruits and vegetables can help boost the health of the heart by providing a range of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.  Vitamin C has an immune-boosting effect that can help the body fight off illnesses, such as the common cold.   One study  found that vitamin C helped prevent  pneumonia  and supported  tetanus  treatment. Also, findings of  an animal study  suggest that vitamin C plays a role in reducing lung  inflammation  that results from the  flu .  Vitamin C is an antioxidant, so it can prevent damage caused by free radicals. This may help prevent diseases such as cancer.  Investigations into whether vitamin C effectively prevents cancer have yielded mixed findings. However, the results of a few studies have been positive:  Vitamin C-rich foods can be a part of nearly any meal. The following breakfast, lunch, and dinner ideas can help a person meet their daily requirement.  Many people have a glass of orange juice with breakfast, but this is high in sugar. In fact, some brands of orange juice contain as much sugar as a soda.  Instead, load up on vitamin C in the morning with some of these breakfast options:  A healthful lunch can help prevent afternoon fatigue and keep energy levels up until dinner. Some ideas for a vitamin C-infused midday meal include:  Dinner can be a rich source of vitamin C when a person tops vegetables or meats with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  When vitamin C accompanies iron-rich plant foods, the body  absorbs the iron more efficiently .  Some dinner ideas include:  Some people may need higher amounts of vitamin C than others. People who smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke, for example, may require more vitamin C to reduce the damage of the free radicals that the smoke releases.  Other groups who may benefit from a higher vitamin C intake include:  If someone cannot get enough vitamin C in their diet, they can take supplements. Many brands are available in drug stores and  online .  Vitamin C is necessary for good health. Because it is abundant in many plant foods, eating a healthful diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables usually provides a person with all the vitamin C that they need.  People who wish to boost their vitamin C intake can do so by eating rich sources of the vitamin each day.
