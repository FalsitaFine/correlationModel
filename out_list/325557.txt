  Pneumonia  can be mild, and people with good health can recover within  1 to 3 weeks .  Infants, adults over  65 years old , people who smoke, or those with an existing lung or chronic health condition are more at risk of pneumonia and life-threatening complications.  Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can all cause pneumonia, which spreads through coughing, sneezing, or close contact with people who have the infection.  Pneumonia can happen to anyone of any age, but the illness causes more risks for certain groups than for others.  The following factors can also make pneumonia more severe or life-threatening:  Children who are younger than  2 years old  are more at risk of pneumonia because their immune systems have not developed fully.  According to the  American Thoracic Society , pneumonia is the leading reason for children in the United States to be in a hospital.  Adults over  65 years old  are also more at risk due to a decline of the immune system as people age. This makes it harder for the body to fight off infections.  People may have a higher risk of getting pneumonia, or more serious cases of pneumonia, in the following circumstances:  Smoking and excessive use of alcohol or drugs can increase the risk of getting pneumonia or more life-threatening cases of pneumonia.  If people have regular exposure to toxic chemicals, pollutants, or secondhand smoke, they may be more at risk of pneumonia, including more life-threatening cases.  Pneumonia can sometimes cause severe complications, including:  Symptoms of pneumonia can include:  If people notice the above symptoms, they should see their doctor.

This applies to infants, people over 65 years old, and anyone with a chronic health condition or weakened immune system.  To diagnose pneumonia, a doctor will take a medical history and carry out a physical examination. They will use a stethoscope to listen to the lungs for sounds of pneumonia when a person inhales. They may also take request a chest X-ray and blood test.  If bacteria are the cause of pneumonia, people can take oral  antibiotics . Many people respond well to treatment at home and recover quickly. If people notice their symptoms are getting worse, they should see their doctor immediately.  People can treat viral pneumonia with antiviral medicines and will usually get better in  1 to 3 weeks .  People with more severe symptoms, existing health conditions, or who fall into a higher risk category, may have to stay in the hospital.  Recovery rates will vary depending on how healthy a person is generally, their age, and any lifestyle factors. Some people with pneumonia can recover in a few weeks, while for others it can take  6 to 8 weeks  to return to normal.  People who might be at a higher risk of getting pneumonia or complications from the infection can get a vaccine to lessen the risk.  There are two types of pneumococcal vaccinations. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  recommend that certain groups of people receive the following vaccines :  Other vaccines that can help prevent getting pneumonia include:  There are also simple steps and lifestyle adjustments that people can make to help prevent pneumonia.  People can wash their hands regularly, particularly during cold and flu season, to help prevent the spread of infections. They can use soap and hot water or antibacterial hand gels to kill germs, especially before eating or touching the face and mouth.  A healthy immune system is essential to allow people to better fight off infections. People can keep their immune system strong by eating a healthful diet, getting plenty of rest, and exercising regularly.  If someone smokes cigarettes, then  quitting smoking  can help reduce the risk of pneumonia infections and their severity. Smoking damages the lungs and reduces the body's ability to fight off infections.  People who are in good health and who get pneumonia respond well to treatment and can recover in a few weeks.  If people fall into one of the following categories, they may be at higher risk of more severe pneumonia and possible complications:  If someone thinks they have symptoms of pneumonia, they should see their doctor immediately, especially if they are in a more at-risk group.  Vaccines to help prevent pneumonia can lower the risk of the infection. Keeping the immune system strong with a healthy lifestyle and by quitting smoking can also reduce the risk of getting pneumonia, and it being a more severe case.
