 Some symptoms can be quite general. These include  headaches , vision problems, and mood changes. Seizures and personality changes can also signal the presence of a brain  tumor .  If a person notices any early symptoms of a brain tumor, they should speak to their doctor for a thorough diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to better outcomes.  This article looks at various symptoms of brain tumors, including those linked to different types and locations of tumor, as well as the risk factors for each.  Brain tumor symptoms are similar regardless of whether they are cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).  They may differ depending on the type, location in the brain, and the stage of the tumor.  Some of the  most common  symptoms of a brain tumor include:  Primary brain tumors are tumors that begin in the brain.  In the sections below, we look at several types of brain tumor and their specific symptoms:  Roughly  one-third  of primary brain tumors are meningiomas. They are usually benign and slow growing.  They grow from tissue covering the brain and spinal cord and create pressure on these areas.  Meningiomas are rare in children and  most common  in women over the age of 60.  Symptoms of meningioma can include:  Glioblastomas are malignant tumors. They can be fast growing and require more intensive treatment.  According to the  American Brain Tumor Association , healthcare providers assign a grade to tumors depending on how abnormal the cells they contain are.  Grade 1 tumors are the least malignant and grade 4 are the most malignant. Glioblastomas  are grade 4 tumors .  Glioblastomas create pressure on the brain, and symptoms include:  Astrocytomas are brain tumors that grow from cells called astrocytes, which make up brain tissue.  They can range from  grade 1 to 4 , with grade 1 tumors being slower growing than grade 4 tumors.  Some of the early symptoms for astrocytoma include:  A craniopharyngioma is a benign tumor that develops close to the pituitary gland. It is  much more common  in children than adults. Medulloblastoma and ependymomas are also  more common among children .  The tumor creates pressure on the pituitary gland and optic tract, which is an extension of the optic nerve. This can cause the following symptoms:  Pituitary tumors develop in the pituitary gland and affect hormone levels. They tend to be  more common  in women and make up 9â€“12% of all primary brain tumors.  They are slow growing, though larger tumors can create pressure on surrounding areas of the brain. These tumors can secrete pituitary hormones and cause additional symptoms.  According to the  American Cancer Society , tumors that start in the pituitary gland are almost always noncancerous.  Symptoms of pituitary tumors include:  Metastatic brain tumors, or secondary brain tumors, form in other parts of the body where  cancer  is present and move to the brain through the bloodstream.  Metastatic brain tumors present the same symptoms as primary brain tumors, with the  most common  symptoms being:  Symptoms of brain tumors can also be similar to those of other medical conditions, such as headaches and  multiple sclerosis  (MS).   Most headaches  do not signal the presence of a brain tumor, and experiencing a headache by itself is usually not a cause for concern.  However, signs that a headache could be a symptom of a brain tumor include:   Learn more about the possible causes of persistent headaches here .  If a person experiences frequent or severe headaches, they may have  migraine , tension, or  cluster headaches . These can also create feelings of nausea.  Symptoms of migraine can range from mild to severe and include:  A migraine headache can last anywhere from a  few hours to a few days, or even weeks .   Read about the possible causes of headache with nausea here .   Tension headaches  are usually mild to moderate, and symptoms include:  Cluster headaches cause severe pain and occur in bursts. These episodes can last anywhere from  1 to 3 hours . Symptoms include:  MS is a condition that affects the  central nervous system  and can produce similar symptoms to those of a brain tumor. Some of the  most common  symptoms include:  Less common symptoms include seizures, problems with speech, and  hearing loss .  People should see their doctor if they experience any of the following symptoms:  A doctor will take a full medical history and perform a range of neurological tests to see what is causing the symptoms. For example, they may:  Also, if they locate a tumor in the brain, they may take a tissue sample, or biopsy, to find out what type it is.  A person should see their doctor if they experience severe or frequent headaches. They will be able to rule out any underlying causes and suggest lifestyle changes or treatment options.  If a brain tumor is present, treatment will depend on the type and stage of the tumor. Options may include surgery,  radiation therapy , or  chemotherapy  to remove or shrink the brain tumor.  People should see their doctor if they experience any of the symptoms listed above. Many of the symptoms overlap with those of other causes and may signal another health condition.  Tracking any symptoms can help a doctor determine a diagnosis. Keeping track of what time and how frequently symptoms occur can also help.  If a person does have symptoms that signal a brain tumor, early diagnosis and treatment are important to help prevent the tumor from growing.
