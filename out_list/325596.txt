 Conditions that may cause a bad smell in the nose include:  Most conditions that cause a bad smell in the nose are not life threatening. However, if the bad smell is severe or chronic, it can negatively impact someone's quality of life and may require medical attention.  This article discusses the causes of a bad smell in the nose, as well as treatments and prevention methods. Several conditions are commonly associated with a bad smell inside the nose, and we cover many of them below.  Sinus infection, called sinusitis, affects around  31 million people in the United States .  Sinusitis causes symptoms such as sinus  inflammation  and nasal congestion, which can interfere with a person's sense of smell.  The condition can also cause  bad breath  and a discolored, bad-smelling discharge in the nose and back of the throat, all of which may create a bad smell in the nose.  Acute sinusitis typically lasts for around  3–8 weeks , while chronic cases can last for longer than 8 weeks. A species of bacteria usually causes sinusitis, though viruses, fungi, and molds can also cause it.  Cavities, or holes in the teeth, can trap bacteria that release unpleasant gases such as sulfur when they break down. Cavities usually arise due to tooth decay or  gingivitis , which can include inflamed gums or gum disease.  These unpleasant gases, which become foul-smelling odors, can travel through small holes in the back of the mouth that connect to the sinuses and cause a bad smell in the nose.  Poor oral hygiene increases the number of food particles left in the mouth that can decay, increasing the risk of developing a bad taste or smell in the mouth.  Dental issues can also increase the risk of developing plaque, which is a thick film of bacteria that can cause tooth decay and inflame the tissues between the teeth and gums (a condition called  periodontitis ).  Foods and drinks are full of microscopic molecules that stimulate the sense of smell.  Most of our ability to enjoy the taste and smell of food and drink relies on molecules traveling to the sinuses through a passageway near where the roof of the mouth connects to the nose.  All foods release smells as our bodies break them down and digest them. However, certain foods and drinks, as well as some drugs, may linger in the mouth or trigger an unpleasant smell in the nose,  especially :  Dry mouth, or xerostomia, can develop when the flow of saliva is not adequate. Most people with dry mouth feel continuously parched and have swollen nasal passages.  Saliva constantly removes unwanted microbes and particles from the mouth. It also neutralizes acids.  So, when there is not enough saliva, a person is more likely to experience conditions that can cause a bad smell or taste in the mouth and nose, such as bad breath and tooth decay.  Dry mouth is also a common side effect of several medications. Causes of dry mouth include:  Tobacco products contain chemicals that stain and weaken the teeth and gums, thus increasing the risk of tooth and gum disease. Tobacco can also give the breath an unpleasant odor.  Smoking can also reduce someone's ability to taste and smell food properly, which may cause someone to smell odors that they perceive as foul, but which may not actually be bad.  People with phantosmia smell things that are not there. It occurs when a condition interferes with a person's sense of smell.  Everyone with phantosmia smells a slightly different scent, but most people experience something that smells:  Phantosmia only affects around  10–20%  of people with smell disorders. However, a wide range of conditions may cause phantosmia, including:   Learn more about phantosmia here .  Some digestive conditions, such as  acid reflux , can cause bad breath and a bad taste in the mouth.  Also, although fairly benign conditions are usually behind a bad or unusual smell in the nose, it is rarely linked to more systemic or serious health conditions, which may include:  The best way to treat a bad smell in the nose depends on the underlying condition.  That said, there are some home remedies that can help reduce a bad smell in the nose:  Using a saltwater rinse can help temporarily reduce the intensity of a bad smell in the nose.  To make a saltwater rinse at home:  People can also use a soft rubber ear bulb syringe or a commercial nasal saline rinse product from a drug store.  Many conditions that result in a bad smell in the nose have dehydration as their root cause. How much liquid someone needs each day depends on their age, activity levels, and diet, among other factors.  People whose bodies do not make enough saliva can use artificial saliva or try sugar-free candies or gums to encourage saliva production.  Foods that require a lot of chewing, such as fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, can also promote saliva production.  Having good oral hygiene can help treat several conditions that cause a bad smell in the mouth and nose. Some recommendations from the  American Dental Association  include:  Some over-the-counter (OTC) medications may also help treat conditions that can cause a bad smell in the nose. OTC medications include:  Some conditions that cause a bad smell in the nose require medical attention. Sinus or nasal infections that last longer than 7–10 days, for example, generally require  antibiotic  treatment for  3–28 days .  A doctor or allergist may also prescribe certain medications or therapies to help a person manage conditions that cause a bad smell in the nose, including:  Depending on the condition that causes it, making certain lifestyle changes can help reduce the risk of developing a bad smell in the nose. Lifestyle changes include:  Sinusitis, mouth infections, and certain foods, drinks, and lifestyle habits are usually behind bad smells in the nose.  People can usually get rid of bad smells in the nose by using home remedies, trying OTC medications, and making lifestyle changes.  However, a bad smell in the nose can decrease someone's quality of life and cause complications such as  malnutrition . It can also be a sign of underlying conditions that require medical treatment.  A person can talk with their doctor about severe or chronic bad smells in the nose, those that do not respond to home remedies, or those that last longer than a week.
