 The human body has millions of hair follicles or small sacs lining the skin. The follicles generate hair and color or pigment cells that contain melanin. Over time, hair follicles lose pigment cells, resulting in white hair color.  In this article, we look at some common causes of prematurely white hair, along with ways to slow the graying process down or prevent it, in some instances.  There can be many causes besides age that result in a person's hair turning white.  Any deficiencies of vitamin B-6, B-12,  biotin ,  vitamin D , or vitamin E can contribute to premature graying.  One 2015 report in the journal  Development  notes various deficiency studies on vitamin D-3, vitamin B-12, and  copper  and their connection to graying hair. It finds  nutritional deficiencies affect pigmentation , suggesting color can return with vitamin supplementation.  A 2016 study reported in the  International Journal of Trichology  looked to factors related to  premature graying in young Indians  under 25 years of age. It found low levels of serum ferritin, which stores iron in the body, vitamin B-12, and the good  cholesterol  HDL-C were common in participants with premature hair graying.  Premature graying of a person's hair is  largely connected to genetics , according to a 2013 report in the  Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology .  Race and ethnicity play roles, as well. Premature graying in white people can start as early as 20 years old, while a person can be as young as 25 years old among Asians, and 30 years in African-Americans populations, according to the  same 2013 study .  While graying is mostly genetic, oxidative  stress  in the body may play a part when the process happens prematurely.  Oxidative stress causes imbalances when  antioxidants  are not enough to counteract the damaging effects of free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that damage cells, contributing to aging and disease.  Too much oxidative stress can promote the development of diseases, including the skin-pigment condition  vitiligo . Vitiligo may also turn the hair white due to melanin cell death or the loss of cell function.  Some medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, may increase a person's risk for graying early. In fact, research published in 2008 showed a connection between  hair abnormalities and thyroid dysfunction .  White hair is also common in  alopecia areata , an autoimmune skin condition that causes  hair loss  on the scalp, face and other parts of the body. When the hair grows back, it tends to  be white due to melanin deficiency .  There are conflicting research studies on real-life stress, such as that caused by injury, leading to premature graying.  One study from New York University, reported in  Nature Medicine , finds that  the cells responsible for hair color  can be depleted when the body is under stress.  Other studies indicate that while stress may play a part, it is only a small part of a bigger picture where disease and other factors contribute.  A study from 2013 reported in the  Italian Dermatology Online Journal , shows that  smokers are 2 1/2 times more likely to start graying  before age 30 as non-smokers.  A 2015 study in the  Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology  also demonstrated that smoking is linked to  premature white hair in young men .  Chemical hair dyes and hair products, even shampoos, can contribute to premature hair graying. Many of these products contain harmful ingredients that decrease melanin.  Hydrogen peroxide, which is in many hair dyes, is one such harmful chemical. Excessive use of products that beach hair will also eventually cause it to turn white.  If genetics or aging is the cause, nothing can prevent or reverse the process. However, treating graying hair could allow color pigmentation to return if the loss is due to a medical condition.  When diet and vitamin deficiencies are the cause of prematurely white hair, correcting these may reverse the problem or stop it from worsening.  A person's diet plays a part in preventing white hair. A diet rich in  antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress .  Antioxidant-rich foods include:  Anyone who has white hair resulting from a vitamin deficiency should consume more foods loaded with those vitamins.  For example, seafood, eggs, and meats are good sources of vitamin B-12, and milk, salmon, and cheese are excellent sources of vitamin D.  Vitamin supplements that are available over the counter can also correct deficiencies.  Smoking has adverse effects on the body and contributes to white hair. And researchers have found a link between the habit and loss of hair pigmentation.  There are plenty of hair dyes on the market that cover white hair, but many of these contribute to premature graying and may cause allergic and adverse reactions.  Natural remedies offer an alternative to slow down hair-whitening without harming the body or causing further hair pigment damage.   Curry leaves . The medicinal use of curry leaves goes back centuries. When combined with hair oil and applied to the scalp, curry leaves can slow premature graying.  One report in the  International Journal of PharmTech Research  highlights the traditional use of curry leaves  to retain black hair color and even prevent premature graying . Curry leaves can be purchased at Indian supermarkets, as well as traditional grocery stores.   Bhringaraj . The false daisy or  bhringaraj will darken hair  and keep it from becoming white early, according to some reports. The juice of the leaves is boiled in  coconut oil  or sesame oil and massaged into the hair.  Bhringaraj leaves are available in oil form.   Indian gooseberry . Also called amla, this is an herbal supplement recognized for  reversing premature graying by promoting pigmentation . Its effectiveness is believed to be because the gooseberry is rich in antioxidants and anti-aging properties.  Amla is available as a fruit in Indian grocery stores. It can also be found, as a powder or supplement, available online or in a traditional health food stores. The powder can be mixed with coconut oil and applied directly to the scalp.   Black tea . Black tea can make hair darker, shinier and softer. It can be used by steeping  3 to 5 tea bags in 2 cups of boiling water , cooling and adding to clean, wet hair. Tea can also be mixed with conditioner, left in the hair for 1 hour, and then rinsed out.   Copper .  Low copper levels can lead to premature graying , according to one 2012 study. Good food sources of  copper  are beef liver, lentils, almonds, dark chocolate, and asparagus.   Ridge gourd . The ridge gourd is known for restoring hair pigment and stimulating the roots of the hair. Regular massaging of ridge gourd oil can prevent hair from turning white. The oil can be purchased online.  With the right diagnosis and treatments, white hair progression can be stopped and reversed in some instances. A balanced diet and good hair care can also help. In some cases, however, the process is irreversible.  Regular use of natural remedies may slow down and possibly reverse white hair. But everyone's hair eventually starts to turn white, and the individual has to decide whether they are comfortable with the white or if they prefer to try and hold back what is a natural aging process.
