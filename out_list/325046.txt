 The term "GAPS" stands for "gut and psychology syndrome." The GAPS diet follows the notion that gut health is linked with overall physical and  mental health .  In this theory, improving gut health can improve other health conditions.  Researchers have not yet fully explored this diet. There is currently limited evidence to suggest that the diet can treat the health conditions it claims to, and there are several controversies around the premise of this diet.  In this article, we look at the evidence for the GAPS diet's claims, how to follow it, and its possible benefits. We also provide example food lists and meal plans.  Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, who invented the GAPS diet, believes that poor  nutrition  and a leaky gut, or increased intestinal permeability, are responsible for many psychological, neurological, and behavioral issues.  At the core of the GAPS diet, people avoid foods that are difficult to digest and might damage the gut flora or gut lining. They replace them with nutrient-rich foods that help the gut heal.  According to the GAPS theory, a leaky gut releases harmful bacteria and toxins into the bloodstream, which then travel to the brain and interfere with the brain functioning. The theory says that eliminating foods that damage the gut could help treat conditions such as  autism  spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), and  dyslexia .  Although  current research suggests  that there is a connection between the brain and the gut, particularly for conditions such as  anxiety  and  depression , there is no strong evidence to suggest that following the GAPS diet will improve psychological or behavioral conditions.  Dr. Campbell-McBride originally designed the GAPS diet with the aim of treating her son's autism. Some people also use the GAPS diet as an alternative therapy for a range of psychological and behavioral conditions, including:  Dr. Campbell-McBride's initial aim with the GAPS diet was to help children with behavioral and mood disorders. However, some adults now use it to improve digestive problems.  Dr. Campbell-McBride believes that children develop autism due to poor nutrition and leaky gut syndrome. She claims that the GAPS diet can "cure" or improve symptoms of autism.  ASD causes a range of symptoms that affect how a person experiences the world and interacts in social settings. Scientists believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of ASD.  Most experts agree that there is no cure for ASD. Many people with ASD do not see autism as something that they need to cure or treat. It is possible, however, to improve health conditions associated with ASD, such as gastrointestinal (GI) problems.  One  2014 systematic review  found that children with ASD had significantly higher rates of GI symptoms than those without. The authors say that children with ASD were more prone to abdominal pain,  constipation , and  diarrhea . It is not yet clear why this is the case.  One  case study  reported that a 12-year-old boy showed significant reductions in GI symptoms and core autism symptoms after 4 weeks of probiotic treatment.  However, findings from a  2014 study  that tested 133 children found no association between intestinal permeability and the presence of ASD symptoms.  To date, there is no solid evidence to suggest that dietary changes can substantially affect ASD.  There is no strong evidence to suggest that the GAPS diet can help treat the conditions it claims to.  Following this diet could, however, improve a person's gut health. It encourages people to eat fewer processed foods and more fruits, vegetables, and natural fats. These simple dietary changes could improve gut health and overall health.  However, GAPS diet guidelines do not explicitly account for all nutritional needs. When following this diet, people should make sure that they are getting enough  vitamins  and minerals to avoid developing nutritional deficiencies.  The following sections discuss the evidence for possible benefits of the GAPS diet.  The GAPS diet could improve gut health in three main ways:  According to a  review study , recent clinical studies have suggested that microbes in the gut can significantly affect brain function.  The researchers suggest that gut imbalances could contribute to schizophrenia and other complex behavioral conditions.  Findings from a  2019 systematic review  suggest that probiotics have strong therapeutic potential for treating depressive symptoms.  However, there is currently no solid research to suggest that changing the diet can effectively treat these conditions.  To follow the GAPS diet, eliminate grains, sugar, soy, pasteurized dairy, starchy vegetables, and processed foods from the diet.  The diet is very restrictive and may take up to 2 years to complete.  There are three stages to the GAPS diet:  Dr. Campbell-McBride recommends that people follow the introduction diet before starting the full GAPS diet.  While highly restrictive, this phase aims to heal the gut and reduce digestive symptoms quickly. It can last anywhere from a few weeks to 1 year.  The introduction diet has six progressive stages. Each stage introduces new foods. People should not progress to the next stage if they experience digestive symptoms, which may include:   Stage 1   In stage 1, the diet consists of:   Stage 2   In stage 2, add the following foods:   Stage 3   In stage 3, add the following foods:   Stage 4   In stage 4, add the following foods:   Stage 5   In stage 5, add the following foods:   Stage 6   In stage 6, add the following foods:  After completing the introduction diet, many people move onto the full GAPS diet.  During the GAPS diet, avoid all grains, sugars, starchy vegetables, refined  carbohydrates , and processed foods. This stage lasts 1.5–2 years.  Acceptable GAPS foods include:  The GAPS diet also recommends that people:  After at least 6 months of normal digestion, people can choose to move on to the reintroduction phase.  The final stage of the GAPS diet involves gradually reintroducing food items over the course of several months.  The diet recommends starting with potatoes and fermented grains. Start with small portions and gradually increase the amount of food, as long as no digestive issues arise. Continue this process with starchy vegetables, grains, and beans.  After completing the GAPS diet, many people continue to avoid refined, highly processed foods.  People can eat the following foods on the GAPS diet:  Foods to avoid on the GAPS diet include:  Start the day with one of the following:  For breakfast:  For lunch:  For dinner:  The GAPS diet claims to help treat autism and other behavioral and psychological conditions. However, no credible research findings support these claims.  As is common in the diet industry, the GAPS diet appears to be part of a larger marketing scheme. Alongside offering dietary advice, the official website sells books, supplements, DVDs, essential oils, organic bitters, and more.   People should therefore proceed with caution.   Those interested in trying the GAPS diet can consult a licensed GAPS practitioner to learn more. However, people should first consider consulting a registered dietitian or other healthcare provider.
