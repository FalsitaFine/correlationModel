 Oral sex refers to when a person puts their mouth, tongue, or lips on the genitals or anus of another person.   Sexually transmitted diseases  (STDs) that people can pass on through oral sex can infect multiple parts of the body, including the:  In this article, we take a look at STDs that people can spread through oral sex and their signs and symptoms.  We also cover how people can transmit these STDs, along with their treatment options.   Gonorrhea  is an STD that  Neisseria gonorrhoeae  bacteria cause.  Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. If people do notice symptoms, they may include:  People can get gonorrhea as a result of having oral sex with someone who has a gonorrhea infection in the throat, vagina, penis, urinary tract, or rectum.  A doctor can take a urine sample to test for gonorrhea. They may also take a swab from the:  Gonorrhea is treatable with  antibiotics , though some strains have now become resistant to antibiotics.  If people continue to experience symptoms after receiving treatment for gonorrhoea, they should see their doctor again.  If a person does not seek treatment for gonorrhea, it can cause serious health complications, including:   Chlamydia  is a common bacterial infection that  Chlamydia trachomatis  bacteria can cause.  Chlamydia infections often have no symptoms.  However, if a person has a chlamydia infection in their throat, they may have a sore throat.  If they have an infection of the rectum, genitals, or urinary tract, symptoms may include the following:  People can get chlamydia as a result of having oral sex with someone who has a chlamydia infection. People with a chlamydia infection in the throat, vagina, penis, or rectum can pass on the infection.  Doctors can diagnose chlamydia by taking a urine sample or a vaginal swab for females.  People can treat chlamydia by taking antibiotics. They should avoid having sex until they have completed the course of treatment.  Chlamydia is treatable with antibiotics. It is important that people seek treatment for chlamydia, as it can spread to a sexual partner if they do not treat it.  It can also cause serious health problems, including:   Syphilis  is a bacterial infection that  Treponema pallidum  cause.  People may not notice any symptoms from syphilis, and the first signs are usually mild. There are four stages of a syphilis infection, and each stage has different symptoms:   Primary   Sores can last for  3–6 weeks  and are self-healing. When the sore heals, the infection is still present. For this reason, it is important that a person continues to receive treatment.   Secondary   Even if these symptoms pass without treatment, it is essential that people still get treatment to remove the infection and prevent it from progressing to further stages.   Latent   The latent stage of syphilis has no symptoms. Without treatment, people may have a syphilis infection for many years without noticing any symptoms.   Tertiary   People do not usually develop tertiary syphilis, but it can happen  10–30 years  after first getting the infection if they do not seek testing and treatment at the time.  People may notice severe complications if they have tertiary syphilis, which may include:  Neurosyphilis occurs when syphilis spreads to the brain or nervous system. Symptoms of neurosyphilis can include:  Tertiary syphilis can be fatal if a person does not receive treatment.  People can get syphilis by engaging in oral sex with a person who has syphilis, specifically by coming into direct contact with a syphilis sore or rash.  A doctor will take a blood test to check whether a person has syphilis. If people have sores, a doctor may test fluid from the sore.  The earlier people receive treatment for syphilis, the easier it is to cure. Doctors can use a  penicillin  injection to treat type of this infection.  Syphilis can cause severe complications and can even be fatal if a person does not receive treatment. If left untreated, syphilis can cause:  If someone has a syphilis infection while pregnant, they can also pass the infection to their baby.   Human papillomavirus (HPV)  is the  most common  STD in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  People with  HPV  may have no symptoms. However, HPV can cause:  If people have warts in the throat, they may feel breathless or have difficulty speaking.  People can get HPV through giving oral sex to anyone who has an HPV infection in the genital area, anus, or rectum.  People with an HPV infection in the throat can also pass on the infection by giving oral sex to a partner.  There is  no specific test  that healthcare providers use to detect HPV, especially in the mouth or throat. Some people may find out that they have HPV if they get an abnormal test result from  cervical cancer  screening, or  a Pap smear .  Others may find out that they have it if they develop  genital warts  or other complications.  People can treat warts from an HPV infection but not the virus itself. A person can remove warts by taking certain medicines or undergoing surgery. Sometimes, the warts disappear by themselves.  HPV often goes away without treatment.  Even if people treat the warts, they can still spread the HPV infection to sexual partners.  Some types of HPV can cause  cancer , including cervical cancer. Many females do not develop cervical cancer if they receive the correct treatment for HPV.  People can get an HPV vaccine to help protect against the diseases that HPV can cause.   Herpes  is an infection that the herpes simplex virus can cause.  Herpes often produces no symptoms, or very mild ones. The main symptoms following initial infection may include:  People can get herpes as a result of having oral sex if a partner has a herpes infection in the mouth, genital area, rectum, or anus.  A doctor may take a skin sample from a sore for testing, or they may perform a blood test to help diagnose herpes.  Although there is no cure for herpes, people can take antiviral medicine to reduce or prevent the symptoms.  With or without treatment, people can spread herpes infections to sexual partners. Taking daily medicine can help reduce the chance of passing on the infection, however.  Having herpes can increase the risk of getting an HIV infection, and pregnant women can pass on herpes to their infant.   Trichomoniasis , or trich, is a common infection that a parasite causes.  Symptoms can include:  If people give oral sex to a partner who has a trichomoniasis infection in the vagina or penis, they may get a trichomoniasis infection in the throat.  People will need to see their healthcare provider for laboratory tests to check for trichomoniasis, as a doctor cannot diagnose it just from the symptoms.  People can treat trichomoniasis by taking a single dosage of antibiotic medicine that can also destroy parasites.  To prevent getting another infection, people should make sure that their sexual partners also receive treatment.  People can easily treat trichomoniasis by taking oral medication.   Hepatitis A  is a virus that causes  inflammation  of the liver.  The symptoms of  hepatitis  A tend to develop after an average of  28 days  from exposure to the virus. These symptoms can include:  Hepatitis A transmission mainly occurs through oral-fecal contact. As a result, a person could contract hepatitis A by performing oral-anal sex with someone who has the virus.  Blood tests can detect the hepatitis A virus if someone has it.  There is no cure for the virus, so doctors will often recommend that a person with the infection rests for  1–4 weeks  and avoids intimate contact with other people.  Although hepatitis A can make people feel very unwell, it rarely causes any complications.   Hepatitis B  is another virus that causes inflammation of the liver.  In many cases,  hepatitis B  causes few or no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they can include:  People with a  hepatitis B  infection can pass on the virus in their semen or vaginal secretions during oral sex.  Doctors can diagnose hepatitis B by performing a blood test. It can take anywhere between  3 weeks and 2 months  for the virus to appear in a person's blood. The test will determine if the infection is acute or chronic.  There is no specific treatment for an acute hepatitis B infection, and most people will fully recover after a short amount of time.  Doctors will treat a chronic hepatitis B infection with medication to slow the progression of the virus and support the immune system. People with an acute infection will typically make a full recovery once the virus has run its course.  In severe cases, hepatitis B can lead to chronic infection, scarring of the liver,  liver cancer , and even death. A vaccine is available to help protect people from this virus, however.   HIV  is a virus that affects the immune system, making people with it more prone to other illnesses.  A person will need to undergo a test to receive a diagnosis of HIV, as it does not always cause symptoms.  The symptoms that a person experiences depend on the stage of the HIV virus.   Early stage   People may experience symptoms similar to the  flu , which can include:  Clinical latency stage  People may experience mild symptoms or none at all during this stage.  The risk of passing on HIV through oral sex is very low, and the person giving oral sex would need to have an open wound in their mouth in order to catch it.  With the correct treatment, a person with HIV cannot transmit the virus to another person.  A healthcare provider can perform a blood or saliva test to determine whether a person has HIV.  Although there is currently no cure for HIV, it is possible to manage the condition effectively with the correct treatment. Treatment for HIV consists of a regimen of antiretroviral drugs called antiretroviral therapy.  If people with HIV take medications as prescribed, they can reduce the amount of the virus in their bloodstream to an undetectable level.  They can live a long and healthy life and avoid passing it on to sexual partners.  If people are having sexual intercourse or oral sex, they can take the following steps to help prevent STDs:  If a person does not have access to a dental dam, they can make one at home using a condom. To make a dental dam, follow these steps:  There are many types of STD that people can transmit or contract as a result of having oral sex.  People can use a condom or a dental dam to help protect themselves and their sexual partners from STDs.  If a person has an STD, it is important that they and their sexual partners receive the correct treatment to prevent any complications arising.  By using appropriate prevention methods and receiving treatment when necessary, people should be able to enjoy oral sex without the risk of STDs.
