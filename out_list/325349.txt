 A sprain is distinct from a strain. Sprains injure ligaments, while  strains affect muscles or tendons .  The symptoms of the two injuries, however, are very similar. For this reason, distinguishing a sprain from a strain without the help of a doctor is difficult.  An ankle sprain can cause  intense pain  in the joint and may make it difficult to move the ankle or walk. Sometimes, a sprained ankle feels like a broken bone.  The pain and other symptoms an ankle sprain causes vary depending on the severity of the sprain, as well as which ligaments it affects. Some sprains involve multiple ligaments.  Doctors  assign a grade  of 1, 2, or 3 to sprains depending on their severity:  Intense pain generally means that there is a more severe sprain, but all sprains can be painful.  Other symptoms include:  A severe sprain may feel like a broken bone. The symptoms may also be similar to a break, including difficulty moving the joint.  People who experience intense muscle or bone pain following an injury should see a doctor.  Some types of sprain are  uncommon in children , especially young ones. This is because  growth plates , which are areas where bones grow that are near the ends of long bones, are weaker than their ligaments.  Children are therefore more likely to  fracture  bones than injure soft tissue.  Some symptoms of a sprained ankle in a child include:  The signs and symptoms of a sprained ankle in a child are similar to those of a broken bone. Caregivers should therefore take a child to the doctor following any serious bone or soft tissue injury.  Any injury that stretches or traumatizes the ligaments can sprain the ankle. Some  common causes  include:  Treating a sprained ankle begins by keeping the ankle still to prevent future injuries. Controlling swelling may help the pain. Once the initial swelling subsides, gently exercising and stretching the ankle can help it heal while preventing muscle weakness.  Mild sprains may not require medical treatment. A few  simple home remedies  can help ease the pain associated with these injuries:  If the sprain is severe or home remedies do not work, a doctor may recommend additional treatment, including:  Many sprains heal without medical treatment, especially if the sprain is minor.  However, only a doctor can accurately diagnose a sprain. This is because sprain symptoms are very similar to those of other injuries and disorders, including bone fractures and arthritis.  See a doctor for a sprain if:  Sprains are common and usually fairly mild, though they can be painful. It is important to take this injury seriously and to rest the ankle to prevent further injury.  A doctor can offer treatment guidelines and ensure that the injury is a sprain and not something more serious.
