 Mucinous  carcinoma  accounts for  1–7%  of all  breast cancer  cases. It usually develops in women  over 60 , and it is  extremely rare  in men.  Mucinous  carcinoma  is an invasive  cancer , meaning that it can spread to other parts of the body. However, it is  less aggressive  than other invasive types of cancer, and it generally responds well to treatment.  Less commonly, mucinous carcinoma first develops in areas other than the breast, such as the colon or rectum.  In this article, we discuss the symptoms, causes, and survival rates associated with mucinous carcinoma. We also explore treatment options.  Mucinous carcinoma is a type of invasive cancer in which mucin — the main component of mucus — surrounds the cancer cells.  While this form of cancer can develop in any part of the body that produces mucin, most cases occur in the breast. Colloid carcinoma is another name for mucinous carcinoma of the breast.  This type of cancer can form alongside other cancer cells, such as those of ductal breast cancer. When this happens, doctors refer to it as "mixed mucinous carcinoma." By contrast, "pure" mucinous carcinoma has  90–100%  mucinous cells.  According to  some estimates , 2–3% of invasive breast cancer cases are pure mucinous carcinomas, while 5% are mixed mucinous carcinomas.  Mucinous carcinoma can also develop in the lungs or in the colon or rectum, in which case the diagnosis may be  colorectal cancer .  Initially, mucinous carcinoma of the breast may not cause symptoms.  As the cancer develops, a lump may form in the breast tissue, and a person may eventually be able to feel it during an examination.  On average, a mucinous carcinoma lump measures  3 centimeters .   Breast cancer symptoms besides a lump  can include:  Colorectal cancer symptoms can include:  The symptoms of mucinous carcinoma of the lung are the same as symptoms of other types of  lung cancer . They can include:  Cancer occurs when the body's regular cellular process breaks down: Old and damaged cells do not die when they should, and new cells grow when they should not.  For mucinous carcinoma of the breast, causes and risk factors are similar to those of breast cancers in general. It is likely that a combination of genetics and environmental factors lead to the cancer developing.  Risk factors for breast cancer include:  Also, the following can each increase breast cancer risk:  In addition, breast cancer risk increases while hormone therapy is ongoing.  Risk factors for  colon cancer  include:  The risk factors for mucinous carcinoma of the lung are the same as those for other types of lung cancer. They include:  Treatment for mucinous carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer, the person's health status, and the affected area of the body.  Also, pure mucinous carcinoma may require less aggressive treatment than the mixed form.  Treatment options include the following:  The aim of surgery is to remove the cancerous cells and any affected lymph nodes.  When treating mucinous carcinoma of the breast, the surgeon may remove the portion of the breast that contains the lump, in a procedure called a lumpectomy. Or, they may remove the entire breast, in a  mastectomy .   Chemotherapy  involves taking medications to destroy cancer cells that may be present outside the main lump.  Hormone therapy is generally  an effective treatment  for mucinous carcinoma of the breast. It can also lower the risk of the cancer returning.  Hormone therapy aims to reduce the amount of  estrogen  in the body or block its effects. This type of treatment is effective for hormone-positive breast cancers.  People with pure mucinous carcinoma of the breast tend to have  higher survival rates  than those with other types of malignant breast cancer.  A 2015 review , for example, reports that there is a 90% survival rate at 10 years after diagnosis.  The survival rates for people with either mixed mucinous carcinoma or mucinous carcinoma in the lungs or colon are not as high.  However, it is important to remember that survival rates give only a general picture. Each person's outlook is different.  The outlook depends upon specific factors, such as the stage of cancer at diagnosis, the size of the  tumor , and the person's general health. A person should discuss their outlook with their doctor, who can take all of the relevant factors into account.  Mucinous carcinoma is an uncommon type of cancer.  When it first develops in the breast, a person tends to have a better outlook than people with other forms of invasive breast cancer.  For the best prognosis, it is important for a doctor to detect and treat the cancer at an early stage. Regular breast self-exams and mammograms are important.  It is also helpful to reduce cancer risk factors whenever possible, such as by avoiding tobacco smoke, eating a healthful diet, and exercising regularly.  When mucinous carcinoma first develops somewhere other than the breast, the survival rates are less high. Early diagnosis and treatment lead to the best outlook.
