 Sometimes, people find it hard to breathe when they are lying down flat. The medical term for this is orthopnea. People who experience this will often need to prop themselves up on pillows so that they can sleep.  There are several possible causes of orthopnea, such as carrying excess weight or having an underlying health condition such as  heart failure .  In some cases, the feeling of breathlessness can wake the person up suddenly. The medical term for this is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. A few things, including snoring and certain sleep disorders such as  obstructive sleep apnea  (OSA), can cause paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  This article will look at some of the more common causes of and treatments for shortness of breath when lying down.  One of the most common causes of orthopnea is heart failure.  In heart failure, the heart can no longer pump blood to the rest of the body as well as it should. Or, it has trouble relaxing after squeezing. So, the pressures in the heart increase, which can cause the fluid to back up into the lungs, abdomen, or legs.  Heart failure can result in  fatigue , shortness of breath, leg swelling, and, in some cases, coughing. Everyday activities such as walking and climbing stairs can become more difficult.  Some signs and symptoms of heart failure include:  There is no cure for heart failure, but people can usually manage the condition by using medications and making healthful lifestyle choices.   Typical medications  for heart failure include:  To treat orthopnea, a doctor may need to adjust a person's diuretic medication to remove the fluid buildup from the lungs and reduce intracardiac pressures.   Emphysema  is a type of lung condition comprising chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This condition damages the air sacs in the lungs and makes the breathing tubes narrower, making it more difficult to breathe.  Smoking causes most cases of emphysema. Passive smoking and poor air quality can also play a role.  People with this condition will usually find it difficult to breathe when carrying out physical activities. In advanced emphysema, people may also experience shortness of breath when sitting or lying down.  The main symptoms of COPD include:  It is not possible to reverse the lung damage that emphysema causes. However,  quitting smoking  can stop the damage from getting any worse.  Treatments for COPD tend to focus on preventing further damage and improving the symptoms. They include:  People who carry excess weight or have  obesity  may have difficulty breathing when lying down due to the compressive effects of the weight on their abdomen. Called "pannus," this phenomenon prevents the lungs from inflating fully.  Around  93.3 million adults  in the United States had obesity in 2015â€“2016.  Obesity has links to health conditions including:  Losing weight can help ease orthopnea. The best way to lose weight is to get plenty of exercise and follow a healthful, balanced diet.  To adopt a healthful diet, try eating:  People who follow a healthful diet often have  lower rates  of heart disease,  diabetes , and some other chronic health conditions.  OSA is a sleep disorder that can cause breathing difficulties while sleeping.  A common sign of OSA is snoring that is interspersed with gasping and choking sounds. People with OSA may also pause their breathing.  Other symptoms of OSA may include nocturia (or getting up to urinate during the night),  depression , irritability, nocturnal palpitations, and sexual dysfunction.   Panic attacks  and  anxiety  attacks can come on at any time and be very frightening. Although these episodes do not fit within the typical orthopnea bracket, they can cause shortness of breath when lying down.  People tend to describe these attacks as the abrupt onset of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes.   Symptoms of a panic or anxiety attack  might include:  There are treatments available for panic disorder and anxiety, including counseling, psychotherapy, and  cognitive behavioral therapy .  Shortness of breath that is not related to strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme temperatures, poor air quality, obesity, or high altitude could be a cause for concern.  Sudden shortness of breath accompanied by chest pain or pressure, fainting, or nausea could be a sign of a more serious medical condition.  If a person suddenly begins experiencing shortness of breath, they should seek medical evaluation.  Orthopnea is the medical term for shortness of breath when lying down. People who experience this condition often have to sleep with their heads propped up on pillows.  Many conditions, including obesity and heart failure, can give rise to orthopnea. Treatments tend to depend on the underlying cause.  Anyone who finds it difficult to breathe because they have obesity may find that the problem eases when they lose weight.  Unexplained shortness of breath or breathing difficulties that are accompanied by chest pain or pressure, fainting, or nausea could be a sign of a more serious medical condition.  Anyone who experiences this should speak to a doctor.
