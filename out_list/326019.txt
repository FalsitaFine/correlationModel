 If they notice them at an early stage, people can  treat ingrown nails at home . However, in severe cases — especially when the nail has become infected — people may need to see a doctor for advice,  antibiotics , or a surgical procedure.  In this article, we explain when a person needs surgery for an  ingrown toenail  and discuss the procedure, recovery time, and risks.  An ingrown toenail, which doctors might call onychocryptosis, is a common complaint.  About 20%  of people who see their doctor for foot problems need help with an ingrown toenail.  This painful condition happens when the toenail grows down into the skin. It most commonly affects the big toe, with the corner of the nail growing into the nail bed. In most cases, it occurs due to tight fitting footwear or improper trimming of the nails.  People can often treat ingrown toenails at home by wearing sandals to avoid putting pressure on the toe, soaking the toe in warm water, and keeping the area clean to help it heal on its own.  However, if there are signs of infection, a person should see a doctor rather than trying to treat the nail at home. People should also seek medical care for an ingrown nail if they have a health condition — such as  diabetes , nerve damage, or poor circulation — that makes home treatment risky.  Ingrown toenails irritate the skin. As a result, they can make it easier for bacteria and other microbes to get in, which  increases the risk  of infection. Promptly treating an ingrown toenail reduces this risk. Some signs of infection include:  If the toenail is very swollen or inflamed, or it does not get better after a few days, a doctor may diagnose an infection and prescribe antibiotics. They might  also prescribe  a special splint to prevent the toenail from growing deeper into the skin. If the toe still does not heal, a doctor may recommend surgery.  Ingrown toenail surgery is usually an outpatient procedure that involves the use of local anesthesia. Local anesthesia means that the person remains awake, but the doctor numbs the area so that the person cannot feel their toe.  Some doctors offer a sedative or twilight anesthesia during the surgery. With twilight anesthesia, the person remains awake but groggy, and they may not remember the procedure.  If a person prefers general anesthesia, the surgery may take longer and require more preparation. With general anesthesia, the individual will be unconscious, making it a good option for people who are very anxious about surgery.  Several surgical procedures can treat an ingrown toenail. An orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist can offer advice on the best option, but a person should be sure to make them aware of relevant health issues, including any prior history of ingrown toenails.  The most common surgeries for ingrown toenails include:  A doctor may also cut deep into the nail bed to relieve swelling or drain infected tissue.  A person can help speed their recovery after ingrown toenail surgery by:  For most people, the wound will heal within several weeks. The pain will steadily lessen in the days following surgery and should have gone by the time the wound heals. It can take several months for the nail to regrow, but the length of time will vary from person to person.  Minor complications  are common  following nail surgery, though serious complications are rare. However, an untreated ingrown toenail carries a much higher risk of complications than nail removal.  People should discuss the benefits and risks of surgery with their doctor, who will take into account their particular risk factors. People with a history of anesthesia complications and those with weakened immune systems may be more vulnerable to complications.  Possible ingrown toenail removal complications include:  Ingrown toenails can be painful, but with proper home or medical treatment, they are rarely serious. Surgery presents some risks, but it can alleviate the chronic pain of an ingrown toenail.  People with ingrown toenails should discuss their treatment options with a skilled, experienced podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon. Excellent medical care and diligent home management can reduce the risk of complications following surgery and increase the likelihood of a full recovery with the regrowth of a healthy nail.
