 In this article, we look at eight possible causes of eyebrow pain, as well as the treatment options for each.   Trigeminal neuralgia  is a condition that causes sharp, intense pain in areas of the face. The trigeminal nerve connects the brain to the face, allowing a person to sense touch and changes in temperature.  Trigeminal neuralgia usually affects just one side of the face, but in rare cases, it can affect both sides.  Some people with this condition may experience a stabbing pain or pain that feels like an electric shock. Others may have a constant aching or burning sensation in the face.   Glaucoma  occurs when excess fluid builds up in the front of the eye and damages the optic nerve. It can cause severe pain around the eyebrow and eye.  Other symptoms of glaucoma include:  It is vital to receive treatment for glaucoma. Without treatment, it can cause permanent vision loss.   Migraine  can cause pain around the eyebrows, eyes, and temples. A migraine episode can last  from 4 hours up to several days .  Symptoms of a migraine episode can include:   Learn more about the differences between migraine and a headache here .  A  cluster headache  is a severe headache that can reoccur between  one and eight times a day  and last from 15 minutes to 3 hours each time.  People may experience a stabbing pain, often either behind the eyebrow or eye or around the temples. This pain and other symptoms usually affect one side of the head.  Symptoms of a cluster headache include:  According to the American Migraine Foundation,  tension headaches  are the  most common  type of headache, and they can last from anywhere between 30 minutes and 7 days.  Pain may spread to the eye, eyebrow, and temple. Symptoms of a tension headache include:   Shingles  is a condition that affects the nerves. It occurs in localized areas, usually on one side of the body. These areas can include the face and neck.  The symptoms of shingles include:  People should see their doctor immediately if they have blisters on their face, especially if they are close to the eyes.   Sinusitis  is the  inflammation  of the nasal cavities. It can create a lot of pressure in the face, and people may feel pain around the eyebrows, nose, forehead, and cheeks.  Symptoms of sinusitis include:  Sinusitis can be either acute or chronic. The symptoms of acute sinusitis usually go away within  a week or 10 days . If the symptoms show no improvement with medical treatment and last longer than 12 weeks, a person may have chronic sinusitis.  Giant cell  arteritis , or temporal arteritis, is a condition affecting the blood vessels along the side of the head.  Inflammation of these blood vessels can cause pain in the face and other symptoms around the head and neck, such as:  According to the Arthritis Foundation, people  over the age of 50 years , particularly Caucasian women, are more likely to develop giant cell arteritis.  Treatment for eyebrow pain depends on the underlying cause:  A person should see their doctor if their eyebrow pain is severe, does not go away, or occurs alongside other symptoms.  People with eyebrow pain should seek medical care straight away if they also have the following symptoms:  People should speak to a doctor if they have symptoms of any of the following conditions:  If symptoms of sinusitis carry on longer than 10 days or do not improve with treatment, a doctor can help.  People may experience pain behind or around the eyebrows for many reasons. Blocked sinuses or headaches can lead to increased pressure and pain around the eyebrows, which should pass once the cause resolves.  In other instances, eyebrow pain is due to an underlying condition, such as glaucoma.  If people have frequent or severe pain around the eyebrows or notice other symptoms, they should see a doctor.
