This pain or discomfort usually gets better with sitting or lying down to rest the back.  People who are overweight may be more at risk for muscle  fatigue  that occurs when standing or walking.  A person can treat muscle fatigue and reduce discomfort in the lower back with:  Maintaining a healthy weight can also help reduce  stress  on the back and legs.  Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spine that can place extra pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.  Spinal stenosis often occurs in the lower part of the back, or lumbar spine, where it can lead to lower back pain when walking or standing. People often find that this pain improves with sitting down or leaning forward.  Other symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can include:  Severe spinal stenosis may lead to bowel and bladder problems and sexual dysfunction.  Spinal stenosis usually occurs as a result of aging and is most common in people over the age of  50 years .  However, some people are born with a narrow spinal canal, and spinal stenosis can also develop following a spinal injury.  A doctor may first recommend nonsurgical treatments for people with spinal stenosis. The options may include:  If a person's pain worsens or does not improve, a doctor may recommend a surgical procedure to stabilize the spine or relieve pressure on the spinal nerves.  As a person ages, the protective disks that sit between each of the vertebrae in the spine can gradually wear down and shrink. Degeneration of these disks can lead to the bones in the spine rubbing against one another, which may cause back pain and stiffness.  While symptoms of  degenerative disk disease  often improve with walking, the pain may get worse when a person is standing or twisting, bending, or lifting.  Other symptoms of degenerative disk disease may include:  Treatment options for degenerative disk disease can include:  If conservative treatments do improve a person's symptoms, a doctor may recommend artificial disk replacement or a spinal fusion.   Hyperlordosis  is an excessive inward curvature of the lower spine that causes the buttocks to become more prominent and the stomach to stick out.  When lying on their back, a person with hyperlordosis may have a noticeable c-shaped curve or large gap in their lower back area. People sometimes refer to this exaggerated posture as "swayback."  Hyperlordosis can sometimes also cause pain and discomfort in the lower back, which may affect movement or get worse with prolonged standing.  Hyperlordosis can result from spinal injuries or conditions such as  obesity ,  osteoporosis , spondylolisthesis, and  rickets .  Treatment options depend on the person's age and the severity of the curvature and symptoms.  A doctor may recommend that children with hyperlordosis wear a back brace while they are still growing. For adults, a doctor may recommend conservative treatments, such as OTC pain relievers, physical therapy, and weight management.  In rare instances, a doctor may recommend corrective surgery.  Lower back pain, when standing or walking, is not always a cause for concern and may get better with home treatment, such as rest, OTC pain relievers, hot and cold therapy, and gentle stretching.  A person should see their doctor if the pain is severe, does not get better, or occurs along with other concerning or debilitating symptoms.  People with lower back pain should seek immediate medical attention if they experience loss of bowel or bladder control or leg movement becomes severely affected.  Some tips to help prevent lower back pain include:  People who have specific questions or concerns about keeping their back healthy and free from pain should talk with their doctor.
