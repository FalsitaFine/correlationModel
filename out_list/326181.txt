 People have two  MTHFR  genes, inheriting one from each of their parents. Mutations can affect one (heterozygous) or both (homozygous) of these genes.  There are two common types, or variants, of  MTHFR  mutation: C677T and A1298C.  Mutations in  MTHFR  genes occur in approximately  25%  of people of Hispanic descent and  10–15%  of people of European descent.  These mutations often lead to high levels of homocysteine in the blood, which can contribute to numerous health conditions, such as:  In this article, we look at  MTHFR  mutations in more detail, including related health conditions, diagnosis, and treatment options. We also discuss how  MTHFR  mutations can affect pregnancy.  Mutations in the  MTHFR  gene can affect the body's ability to process amino acids — namely homocysteine and  folate  — which can lead to adverse health outcomes.  Conditions that researchers have associated with  MTHFR  gene mutations include:  Symptoms vary both among individuals and depending on the type of mutation. People usually do not know that they have an  MTHFR  mutation unless they experience severe symptoms or undergo genetic testing.  Having one or two  MTHFR  mutations can slightly increase the levels of homocysteine present in the blood or urine. This condition is called homocystinuria.  Homocysteine is an amino acid that the body produces by breaking down dietary proteins. High levels of homocysteine can damage blood vessels and lead to blood clots. People who have high homocysteine levels tend to have low levels of  vitamin  B-12.  Symptoms of homocystinuria due to  MTHFR  mutations include:   Learn more about homocystinuria here .  A doctor can determine whether a person has an  MTHFR  variant by reviewing their medical history, considering their current symptoms, and performing a physical examination. A doctor may recommend running a blood test to check a person's homocysteine levels.  Although it is possible to identify an  MTHFR  gene mutation through genetic testing, organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommend against  screening for common  MTHFR  gene variants.  Medical treatment is not always necessary for  MTHFR  variants. Dietary and lifestyle changes can often help offset any resulting nutritional deficiencies.  However, people may require medical treatment if they have high homocysteine levels. A doctor may suggest that people with elevated homocysteine levels take the  following supplements :  The  MTHFR  gene regulates how the body processes folate, an amino acid in animal proteins, and other B vitamins. Eating food rich in folate may help reduce symptoms that are due to  MTHFR  mutations.   Folate-rich foods  to try include:  Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate that is available as a supplement. However, people who have an  MTHFR  mutation may get more benefit from taking supplements that contain 5-MTHF, which is the reduced form of folate.  Researchers have yet to determine the benefits of folate supplementation for treating people with  MTHFR  mutations.   Learn more about folate here .  Women who test positive for an  MTHFR  mutation may have an increased risk of  preeclampsia , recurrent miscarriages, or giving birth to a baby with congenital disabilities.  A  2015 meta-analysis  of 54 case-controlled studies revealed strong evidence to suggest that women who have  MTHFR  C677T genotypes have a higher risk of preeclampsia.  According to the researchers, this mutation was present 1.371 times more often among women with preeclampsia.  In a  2018 study , researchers found that early pregnancy loss occurred more frequently in women with the  MTHFR  C677T mutation than in those with the  MTHFR  A1298C mutation.  The researchers also noted strong associations between  MTHFR  variants and the following pregnancy outcomes:  The  Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center  state that studies suggest that women with two C677T gene variants may have a higher risk of giving birth to a child with a neural tube defect.  Neural tube defects refer to disabilities of the brain, spine, or spinal cord that are present at birth. They  usually develop  during the first month of pregnancy.  People inherit one copy of the  MTHFR  gene from each of their parents, which means that everyone has two  MTHFR  genes. Mutations can occur in one or both genes.  Having a parent or close relative with an  MTHFR  gene mutation can increase a person's risk of inheriting the same variant.  People who have two parents with mutations have an increased risk of having a homozygous  MTHFR  mutation.  A person should see a doctor if they experience symptoms of a folate or vitamin B-12 deficiency, which may include:  A person should also see a doctor if they experience symptoms of anemia, which may include:  Having an  MTHFR  mutation does not affect everyone in the same way. People who have one or more  MTHFR  variants may have higher-than-normal levels of homocysteine in their blood or urine.  Although current research has identified associations between  MTHFR  variants and numerous health conditions, more research is necessary to determine the exact effects of these gene mutations on health.  People can speak with their doctor about the benefits and risks of genetic testing. However, most health organizations do not recommend genetic testing unless a person experiences significant health effects.
