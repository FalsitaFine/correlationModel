 Stool also typically contains mucous, dead cells, or any other waste the body is able to excrete. In this article, learn about what causes fatty stool and how it is treated.  Steatorrhea is not usually a major health concern and happens after eating meals high in fat, fiber, or  potassium  oxalate.  Some foods that are especially high in indigestible or difficult to digest fats and fibers are likely causes of steatorrhea.  Common foods and drink known to cause steatorrhea include:  Severe or long-term symptoms of steatorrhea may be a sign of a medical condition, such as a malabsorption disorder, enzyme deficiency, or gastrointestinal disease.  Medical conditions known to cause steatorrhea include:  Steatorrhea is when a person has a loose but bulky stool with globs of fat and noticeable oil separation. Mild or short-term cases of steatorrhea may cause some limited discomfort.  Additional symptoms of mild steatorrhea include:   Malnutrition  and  dehydration  may be caused by severe or chronic cases of steatorrhea. Further, serious symptoms can occur as well, especially when associated with underlying medical conditions.  Symptoms associated with severe or chronic steatorrhea include:  A doctor will usually diagnose steatorrhea by asking about a person's symptoms, reviewing their medical history, and ordering a fecal fat test to assess the fat content of stool.  While some doctors may use a 24-hour test, fecal fat is best assessed when collected for 72 hours.  To prepare for a fecal fat test, an individual must consume 100 grams (g) of fat daily for 3 days prior to the test, and fast for 5 hours directly before the test.  They will need to collect a stool sample using a collection kit and instructions and take the sample to their clinic or doctor's office.  When consuming 100 g of fat daily, a healthy individual should excrete 7 g or less per day of fat in their stool.  Steatorrhea is typically defined as excreting more than 7 g of fat in a 24-hour period when consuming 100 g of fat daily.  If steatorrhea is diagnosed, a doctor will likely need to do further tests to determine the underlying cause.  The treatment for steatorrhea depends on the cause and severity of symptoms. Mild cases of steatorrhea can often be successfully treated at home with rest and basic care.  Following certain dietary guidelines may also help reduce the risk of fatty stool.  Home remedies for treating and preventing steatorrhea include:  Severe or chronic cases of steatorrhea will normally need medical intervention. People with steatorrhea because of an underlying medical condition will also usually need medical treatment.  Medications used to treat and prevent steatorrhea include:  Severe, chronic steatorrhea requires medical attention. Mild to moderate steatorrhea may only cause minor dehydration and discomfort but these symptoms can lead to serious conditions, including  heart attack  and organ failure, if left untreated.  Steatorrhea can also be a sign of underlying medical conditions that require treatment. These include gastrointestinal disease, enzyme deficiencies, or hypoparathyroidism.  The presence of fat in a stool sample can help diagnose these conditions.
