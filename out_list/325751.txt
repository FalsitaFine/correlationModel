  Enteroviruses cause many summer colds , triggering upper respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose and  sore throat , as well as stomach problems.  Enteroviruses are more common in the summer months than rhinoviruses, which are more common in colder months.   Antibiotics  cannot usually treat colds, but home remedies can help a person feel better faster. Read on to learn more about getting a cold in the summer and how to alleviate the symptoms.  Most summer colds cause symptoms similar to those of winter colds, including:  Many winter colds do not cause  fevers , especially in adults, but summer viruses due to enteroviruses  may cause a sudden fever .  Although some people insist that summer colds are always worse or longer lived than winter colds, there is little clinical evidence to support this claim. Most summer colds, like winter colds, go away within a few days and do not require medical treatment.  Some enteroviruses cause other illnesses with different symptoms. These include:  Rarely, enteroviruses can cause serious and potentially life threatening illnesses, such as  meningitis  and myocarditis.  It can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and allergies, particularly when symptoms strike at the start of allergy season.  Some important distinctions include:  No medication can kill the viruses that cause most summer colds. However, a range of treatments can help with the symptoms. These treatments include:  A person should always consult a doctor before giving medication to babies and young children. Also, a person should avoid mixing multiple drugs unless a doctor suggests doing so.  Some evidence suggests that herbal remedies may help with some symptoms. Honey, for example, may help with coughing, while zinc may help shorten the cold. However, never give honey to an infant under 1 year old.  That said, all herbal remedies present some risks, and there has not yet been enough research to conclusively support the effectiveness of these remedies. For this reason, it is vital to consult a doctor before trying an alternative remedy.  Occasionally, colds can cause secondary infections. For example, some children develop ear infections after a cold. Antibiotics can treat these secondary infections.  However, it is important to note that antibiotics do not treat colds. Using them for this purpose can make antibiotics less effective over time, which contributes to antibiotic resistance.

  A person can get a summer cold when they come into contact with germs from an infected person's body fluids, such as their saliva, mucus, or feces.  For example, if a sick person sneezes into their hand and then shakes another person's hand, the virus can spread.  Likewise, if tiny particles of feces linger in swimming pools and other public places, this can also cause enterovirus to spread.   More than 200 different types of virus  can cause colds, and the length of time they are contagious for varies. In general, a person is contagious when they have a fever and for at least a day after.  People are more likely to be contagious when their symptoms are severe. Most people are contagious for several days.  Risk factors for catching a summer cold include:  To reduce the risk of catching or spreading a summer cold, try these strategies:  Summer colds are not typically worse than winter colds, but they can feel more isolating â€” especially if everyone else is enjoying the pool, summer festivals, or other outdoor activities.  For most people, a summer cold is a minor inconvenience. However, colds can sometimes cause serious complications, especially in people with weak immune systems, newborns, and older people.  If the symptoms last for longer than a few days, if a newborn develops a cold, or if a person develops a very high fever, it is best to see a doctor.
