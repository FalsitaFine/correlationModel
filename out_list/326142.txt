 Some manufacturers specifically market their medications to increase appetite. Others simply have this as a side effect.   Vitamins , minerals, and herbs may also act as orexigenics, as can lifestyle and dietary changes.  Although many people consider an increase in appetite to be negative, some people may need to stimulate their desire to eat.  Certain conditions — such as  cancer , psychological conditions, and aging — can lead to unintentional weight loss due to decreased appetite. Losing too much weight can impact a person's quality of life and increase their risk of illness.  In this article, we list several appetite stimulants, ranging from medications and supplements to lifestyle changes.  The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  have approved the following three medications for use as appetite stimulants:  Megestrol is a  progesterone  based medication that doctors can prescribe to boost appetite in people with  anorexia , cancer,  HIV , or  AIDS .  It may also treat  breast cancer  and endometrial cancer. The drug is available in liquid or tablet form.  Side effects of megestrol acetate include  stomach upset , mood changes, and sleep problems. Serious reactions include  swelling due to fluid buildup in the tissues , the onset or worsening of  diabetes , and blood clots.  Oxandrolone is an oral steroid that helps people gain weight following surgery, trauma, or chronic infection.  The most common side effects of oxandrolone include:  It can  also cause  elevated liver enzymes (which return to normal once people stop taking the medication) and reductions in high density lipoprotein, or "good,"  cholesterol  levels.  Dronabinol is a cannabinoid that doctors can prescribe to help treat AIDS-related anorexia.  It can also boost appetite in people with cancer, as well as reduce the nausea and vomiting that results from  chemotherapy  treatment.  Dronabinol is available as an oral capsule. Some of its most common side effects are:  Although megestrol acetate, oxandrolone, and dronabinol are the only drugs that the FDA have approved as appetite stimulants, some other medications have the side effect of increasing appetite.  Some doctors may prescribe them off-label, or for their primary purpose, for this reason. These  include :  Certain vitamins and minerals, including zinc and vitamin B-1, can increase appetite. However, these usually only work if the person has deficiencies in these nutrients.  Other supplements, such as  omega-3  fatty acids, may boost appetite.  Also, many advocates of naturopathy claim that bitter herbs can increase a person's desire to eat.  Zinc deficiency can  cause symptoms  such as loss of appetite and poor immune function. It may also cause changes in taste perception, slow healing, and  hair loss .   Research  in animals suggests that taking zinc supplements may stimulate appetite in people with zinc deficiencies.  Also known as thiamine, vitamin B-1 is essential for growth and development.  A vitamin B-1 deficiency  usually causes  appetite loss, weight loss, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats in the human diet.  Some  research  suggests that marine based omega-3 fats may improve appetite and a person's desire to eat. Fish oil and fatty fish such as salmon are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids.  Vegetarians and vegans may wish to try algae based omega-3 supplements.  Advocates of naturopathy may recommend bitter tasting herbs, or "bitters," to people who want to improve their appetite or digestion. Many people around the world  commonly use  these herbs "to support upper digestive activity."  Examples include gentian and wormwood. People who are curious about trying bitter herbs to stimulate their appetite should see a specialist in naturopathic medicine.  The following lifestyle and dietary changes may help some people increase their appetite naturally:  Getting regular exercise increases the amount of energy a person burns. In turn, this can increase the body's need for fuel, which boosts hunger levels.  Proper planning can help people consume enough  calories  each day. To do this:  To do this, people can try one or more of the following:  Older adults or people with limited mobility can face challenges when it comes to appetite and weight loss.  The following tips may help address some of these challenges:  Some infants and children struggle to eat, either due to appetite loss or for other reasons.  To encourage healthful food intake among infants, toddlers, and young children:  Loss of appetite can occur as the result of aging, medical conditions, or the side effect of medications. However, it is important to address this issue, as it can increase the risk of illness and other complications.  Trying appetite stimulants can be an effective way to boost a person's desire to eat. Options include medications, supplements, and lifestyle changes.  It is important to see a doctor for appetite loss that persists for more than a few days. A doctor can determine the underlying cause and recommend a course of action.
