 In this article, we look at some of the conditions that might be causing red spots on the penis.  People with genital  eczema  may experience the following symptoms:  People should see a doctor to check whether they have genital eczema or another condition.  Treatment may include topical steroids or emollients, which people can use in place of their usual soap to wash.  Some skin care products, including shower gel, antiseptic solutions, and hemorrhoid creams, can irritate genital skin and cause eczema. Some people find that even the laundry detergent that they use to wash their clothes can cause eczema. Sweating and friction from tight clothing are also potential causes.  Genital eczema can sometimes be due to a contact allergy, which spermicides and  latex condoms  can trigger in some people.  Avoiding harsh cleaning products and wearing loose clothing during treatment may help relieve symptoms.  Genital  herpes  is a  sexually transmitted infection  (STI) that can cause red sores to appear on the penis and genital area.  People may not notice any symptoms, or they may only have very mild symptoms. Red blisters are the main symptom of genital herpes. These blisters may appear on and around the genitals, and they can sometimes burst, leaving sores.  People may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as aches, a  fever , and swollen glands, during a herpes outbreak.  Herpes is not curable, but people can take medication to prevent outbreaks of blisters and lessen the chances of passing the infection on to sexual partners.  Genital  psoriasis  is psoriasis that appears anywhere on the genitals.  Inverse  or  plaque psoriasis  can appear as small, red patches on the tip or shaft of the penis.  Treatment options can include:  People should only use medication specifically for use on the genitals. Using general psoriasis cream on the genitals can damage the delicate skin on this part of the body.  Genital psoriasis is not contagious, but if the skin feels sore, people may want to wait before having sex.  Washing the penis before and after having sex and applying a moisturizer for sensitive skin can help prevent irritation.   Balanitis  is an  inflammation  of the tip, or glans, of the penis. Symptoms of balanitis include:  Balanitis can happen due to:   Diabetes  can also cause balanitis when it results in excess sugar in the urine, which can encourage bacterial growth on the glans and under the foreskin.  The type of treatment will depend on what is causing balanitis. Options may include:  Practicing good hygiene and cleaning under the foreskin can help reduce the risk of balanitis.   Syphilis  is an STI that can cause red sores on and around the penis. There are four stages of syphilis, each of which has different symptoms:  It is vital that people get treatment for syphilis. Without treatment, it can cause serious health problems and even be life-threatening.  Antibiotics can treat syphilis, but some of the damage that it does is not reversible.   Scabies  mites cause scabies when they infest the skin. People can get scabies from having skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infestation, including during sexual intercourse.  Scabies can cause an itchy rash to appear on the penis. The rash may look like small  pimples , scales, or blisters, and the itching can be particularly severe at night.  Scabies mites dig burrows under the layers of the skin to lay their eggs. These appear as raised, white, or skin-colored lines on the surface of the skin.  A doctor can prescribe scabies medications called scabicides to kill the scabies mites. People can apply scabicides topically all over their body, usually from the neck downward.   Jock itch  is a fungal infection that causes itchiness and a red rash on the penis. It can spread to the rest of the genital area, buttocks, and inner thighs. People may also feel a burning sensation in the groin area.  Topical antifungal creams can help treat fungal infections, including jock itch. If these are not effective and the infection continues, people may need to see a doctor for stronger oral medications.  Maintaining good hygiene and wearing loose clothing in hot weather can also help relieve symptoms during treatment.   Molluscum contagiosum  is a viral infection that causes red, pink, or skin-colored raised spots to appear on the penis or genitals.  These bumps on the skin are the only sign of molluscum contagiosum. They are not typically painful, but they may be itchy.  The virus can pass easily through direct skin-to-skin contact, and it thrives in hot and humid climates.  People with a weakened immune system, for example, those living with  HIV  or undergoing  cancer  treatment, may get more severe cases of molluscum contagiosum.  Treatment can help remove the bumps and stop the virus from spreading, but it is not always effective. The bumps often go away without treatment over time.  Treatment options for molluscum contagiosum include:  Some medications can cause an allergic reaction that creates rashes on certain areas of the body.  For example, ingredients in some antibiotics can cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which leads to the formation of blisters on the penis that can spread to other areas of the body.  Drug rashes usually clear up once people stop taking the medication. However, people may need to take another medicine, such as a corticosteroid or antihistamine, to help clear the rash.  Rashes and allergic reactions to drugs can have serious symptoms, so if a person notices a rash on their body after starting a new medication, they should see their doctor.  One type of  human papillomavirus  can cause Bowenoid papulosis, which is an STI. It appears as small red, brown, or purple spots on the penis or anus.  Bowenoid papulosis can often clear up on its own within a few months, but some people may need treatment. Treatment options include:  In rare cases, Bowenoid papulosis can lead to Bowen disease, which is an early form of penile cancer.  People with Bowenoid papulosis should see their doctor if the condition does not improve with treatment.  Practicing good hygiene by washing the penis regularly and changing clothes after exercising or when in hot weather can help reduce the risk of infection.  Those with an uncircumcised penis should also take care to clean under the foreskin to prevent bacteria from building up.  Using a condom during sex can help lower the risk of contracting and passing on STIs.  There are many possible causes of red spots on the penis, most of which are highly treatable.  People should see their doctor if red spots on the penis do not go away, the spots cause severe itchiness or pain, or there are signs of infection.  Anyone who experiences a rash that spreads rapidly, occurs alongside fever, or begins to blister should seek medical help straight away.
