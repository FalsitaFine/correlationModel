 People have used turmeric for a variety of health conditions for thousands of years. One of its compounds, curcumin, may have anti-inflammatory properties. Because  inflammation  is one of the causes of  arthritis  symptoms, turmeric may help people with arthritis pain and stiffness.  The  Arthritis Foundation  recommend turmeric for some people with arthritis. A  systematic review and meta-analysis from 2016  found that taking 1,000 milligrams (mg) of curcumin for up to 12 weeks helped relieve pain and inflammation from arthritis. However, the authors note that the study was not large enough to produce definitive results.  Because turmeric is a cooking spice, people can use it in a variety of ways to flavor foods and beverages. Using turmeric in recipes can add inflammation-fighting power to meals and drinks throughout the day.  One of the most basic ways to consume turmeric is to make it into a tea.   To make turmeric tea , add a teaspoon (tsp) of turmeric to 4 cups of hot water and simmer for 10 minutes. Pure turmeric powder, grated turmeric, or ground, dried turmeric all work well.  If any flakes, grains or pieces of turmeric remain, strain the tea before drinking it.  People can try adding other spices or sweeteners to the tea for flavor, such as:   Learn more about the benefits of turmeric tea here .  Golden milk is a milk-based liquid with added turmeric, which gives it a golden and creamy appearance. People may use dairy milk or a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut milk or almond milk.   This golden milk recipe  suggests adding 1 tsp of turmeric to 2 cups of the milk of choice. Try adding a pinch of ground black pepper, which could enhance the effects of the turmeric.  Adding black pepper to golden milk may help the body absorb turmeric.  A review of curcumin and health  says that a compound found in black pepper can help increase the bioavailability of turmeric by up to 2,000%.  Many recipes suggest that adding extra fat, such as coconut or almond oil to the milk, may help the body absorb the turmeric better.  People can also add half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder, 1 tsp of honey, or 1 tsp of maple syrup for taste.  People can drink golden milk or use it as a base for other recipes, such as soups or dressings.   Coffee  lovers or those looking for a caffeine kick can add golden milk to their coffee. Prepare 6 ounces (oz) of warm golden milk as directed and add 2 oz of freshly brewed espresso or 4 oz of fresh coffee.  Turmeric blends well into many fruit smoothies. People who already have a favorite morning smoothie can try adding 1â€“2 tsp of turmeric powder to their recipe.  For a morning anti-inflammatory smoothie and an antioxidant boost,  try this recipe . It includes a range of ingredients that help fight inflammation, including:   This recipe  is another take on a turmeric smoothie.

This recipe  incorporates golden milk into rolled oats for a filling breakfast.  For an extra inflammation-fighting boost, add  blueberries  or strawberries. According  to research , they are rich in anthocyanin, a flavonoid that has potent anti-inflammatory power, and antioxidants to help fight infections.  Eggs are a versatile food, and adding turmeric to them is an easy way for a person to increase their intake of this spice.  People can add 1 tsp of turmeric powder to their regular eggs, or follow a turmeric scrambled egg recipe, such as  this one .  Leafy green vegetables are nutritious and are among the best vegetables for people with arthritis to eat, according to the  Arthritis Foundation . A base of spinach,  kale , or swiss chard combined with other veggies, such as carrots and peppers, will create a filling salad that can help fight inflammation.  This recipe for an  anti-inflammatory turmeric dressing  can further enhance the inflammation-fighting power of vegetables. It includes a coconut cream and olive oil base combined with other seasonings and flavors.  The  Arthritis Foundation  recommend ginger for its inflammation-fighting power. This  creamy soup  includes both turmeric and ginger along with carrots and lemon.  Pair this soup with a salad or fresh fruit for a filling lunch that could help with arthritis symptoms.

People can experiment with turmeric by adding small amounts of the spice to their favorite recipes.  Turmeric usually works well when added to :  When trying turmeric for the first time, use a smaller amount, such as a quarter teaspoon per serving, and increase the amount as needed.  A person's diet plays an essential role in their body's inflammation level. While turmeric fights inflammation on its own, eating an anti-inflammatory diet can help lower inflammation even further, providing additional relief of arthritis symptoms.  The  Arthritis Foundation  recommend that people with arthritis adopt an anti-inflammatory diet. However, the specific types of foods vary slightly depending on the type of arthritis a person has.  For  rheumatoid arthritis  or other inflammatory arthritis, a person should eat:  For osteoarthritis, a healthful diet should include:  People who have osteoarthritis may also find some symptom relief after achieving a healthy weight. Being overweight can put extra  stress  on joints and cause more pain.  People who have  gout  may wish to follow a different type of diet because certain foods have links to gout attacks. Foods that are high in purine can cause a buildup of uric acid, which causes inflammation and pain.  However, the  Arthritis Foundation  caution that an overly restrictive diet for gout is not always enough to lower uric acid levels and can be difficult for people to follow.  Nonetheless, some foods to focus on that may help with gout symptoms include:  People with arthritis may wish to avoid foods that promote inflammation, such as:  People may also wish to try avoiding gluten and dairy products for a time to see if their arthritis symptoms improve.  Eating a healthful, anti-inflammatory diet that includes the turmeric may help people manage symptoms of arthritis and promote better health overall.  People can find turmeric in various forms in health food stores and supermarkets. Otherwise, choose between a range of options online:  People should speak with their doctor or nutritionist to determine the types of foods that may be best for them.  How much turmeric should I take for arthritis?  One meta-analysis concluded that  1,000 mg per day  of curcumin was an effective dose for arthritis. Take care not to take higher doses as some  research  has linked this to iron deficiency. You can break the dosage up and take it twice a day with food.
