 In autoimmune conditions such as  lupus , the body's immune system attacks healthy cells.  According to the Lupus Foundation of America, more than  1.5 million  people in the United States have lupus. Around 70 percent have  systemic lupus erythematosus .  Systemic lupus erythematosus affects the whole body and can attack virtually any part of it, including skin, major organs, hair, muscles, joints, and the digestive system.  Most people with lupus receive a diagnosis between the ages of 15 and 44.  Only around 15 percent  of people experience symptoms of lupus before the age of 18.  Demographic and other factors can affect the severity and progression of the condition.  Lupus is most prevalent  among women of childbearing age, and it is "two to three times more prevalent among women of color," according to the Lupus Foundation of America.   Research from 2014  found that women in minority groups develop lupus younger, have more severe symptoms, and are more likely to die from lupus than others.  Lupus may cause symptoms that are subtle at first but get progressively worse. The symptoms may also appear suddenly or gradually.  Many people with lupus do not receive a diagnosis straight away because  it can mimic other conditions , including  fibromyalgia ,  rheumatoid arthritis , and various others that affect the same organ systems.  Virtually any symptom of illness or  inflammation  can signal lupus. However, some of the symptoms most closely  associated with lupus include :  There are other types of lupus beside systemic lupus erythematosus. Other types include:  Some people develop cutaneous lupus, which affects areas of sun-exposed skin. There are  three types  of cutaneous lupus: acute, subacute, and chronic.  Symptoms include:  Exposure to sunlight can make these types of lupus worse. Some people with skin lupus may develop lupus inside their body, too.  Some babies are born with  neonatal lupus , which occurs when the mother's antibodies attack the baby. Typically, the mother and baby do not have systemic lupus erythematosus, though some women may develop it later on.  Symptoms include:  Neonatal lupus usually disappears within 6 months.  Over time, lupus can lead to severe complications. Such complications may include:  No single test can diagnose lupus. Instead,  a doctor must look for signs  of systemic inflammation, which indicates that the immune system may be attacking the body.  To help with diagnosis, doctors may:  In some cases, a doctor may recommend waiting to see how and whether symptoms change over time.  Lupus is a chronic condition. There is currently no cure, but there are some treatments that can help a person manage their symptoms and prevent serious complications.  The right treatment varies from person to person, and a person's treatment needs may change with time. Sometimes, a medication that once worked well stops working or begins to cause severe side effects.  For these reasons, it is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.  The  following medications  may help treat lupus:  Scientists are researching other strategies for treating lupus. Clinical trials offer hope to some people with the condition, so it may be worth asking a doctor whether any trials are taking place locally.  Some people with lupus find relief from alternative remedies, such as  acupuncture  and special diets. Clinical research has not yet found solid evidence to suggest that these treatments work. However, trying them in conjunction with other treatments is harmless.  Many people with lupus find it challenging to live with. Some people might struggle with  anxiety  about their long-term outlook or feel as though they have little control over their body or life.  Chronic pain and fatigue can be debilitating, making it difficult to work. This can cause financial woes that make some treatments inaccessible.  Support groups can help people with lupus talk through their emotions, feel less isolated, and uncover potentially effective treatment options.  Some people also find relief from psychotherapy and other strategies to improve  mental health .  Despite the fact that there is currently no cure for lupus, there are many potentially effective treatments. People with lupus can live long and happy lives. Also, women with the condition can have successful pregnancies.  People who suspect that they may have lupus should seek prompt treatment. The longer it progresses untreated, the more likely it is to cause serious complications.  A doctor who is knowledgeable about lupus is the best ally in its treatment, so choose a doctor who listens and cares.
