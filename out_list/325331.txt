 Severe neuralgia can interfere with a person's ability to perform everyday tasks and may impact their quality of life.  Neuralgia has many possible causes, including:  This article covers the different types of neuralgia, their symptoms, and the treatment options available.  Healthcare professionals divide neuralgia into categories depending on the areas of the body it affects. The following are some common types of neuralgia:   Trigeminal neuralgia  (TN) involves the trigeminal nerve in the head. It has three branches that send signals from the brain to the face, mouth, teeth, and nose.  TN falls into two  subdivisions : type 1 and type 2.  Type 1 TN causes a painful burning or electric shock-like sensation in parts of the face. People with type 1 TN experience irregular episodes that come on suddenly.  The duration of these episodes varies among people but can last up to  2 minutes , according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.  Type 2 TN produces a constant, dull aching sensation in the face.  The exact cause of TN remains unclear. However, pressure from an enlarged blood vessel can irritate or even damage the trigeminal nerve.   Multiple sclerosis  (MS) can give rise to TN. MS is a  neurological disorder  that causes  inflammation  that damages the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers in the  central nervous system .   Postherpetic neuralgia  (PHN) is a painful condition that affects the nerves in the skin.  According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , PHN is the most common complication of shingles, affecting about 10–13% of people who develop it.  Shingles is a viral infection that causes blisters and a painful skin rash. The varicella-zoster virus, which causes  chickenpox , remains dormant in the nervous system and reactivates later in life, causing shingles.  When the virus reactivates, it can cause inflammation in the nerve fibers. This inflammation can lead to permanent nerve damage that causes pain, even after the infection subsides.  This form of neuralgia affects the occipital nerves, which originate in the neck and send signals to the back of the head.  Occipital neuralgia causes a throbbing or shooting pain that starts near the base of the skull and radiates along the scalp. Occipital neuralgia pain can flow to the back of the eyes.   Occipital neuralgia  has numerous potential causes, including:  Peripheral neuralgia, or peripheral  neuropathy , refers to pain that occurs due to nerve damage in the peripheral nervous system. This includes all nerve fibers outside of the brain and spinal cord.  Peripheral neuralgia can affect a single nerve or entire nerve groups.  Sustaining damage to the peripheral nervous system can affect nerves that control muscle movements, transmit sensory information, and regulate internal organs.  Peripheral neuralgia can  cause pain or numbness  in the hands, feet, arms, and legs. Other symptoms may include:  Intercostal neuralgia affects the nerves that sit just below the ribs. Doctors call the muscles in this area the intercostal muscles.  Several potential factors may contribute to intercostal neuralgia, such as:  Intercostal neuralgia causes a sharp, burning pain that affects the chest wall, upper abdomen, and upper back. Certain physical movements, such as breathing, coughing, or laughing, can worsen the pain.  Additional symptoms may include:   Diabetic neuropathy  is the most common complication of diabetes. Because diabetes affects so many people, rates of peripheral neuropathy are now beginning to rise.  Symptoms include loss of balance and numbness, tingling, and pain. The best way to prevent diabetic neuropathy is to bring blood sugar levels within a suitable range.   Learn more about diabetic neuropathy here .  In general, neuralgia causes intense and distinct symptoms, including:  Treatment options for neuralgia vary depending on the type and severity of the condition.  Topical ointments, local nerve block, and steroid injections may offer temporary pain relief for mild neuralgia.  Treating severe neuralgia pain may require prescription medications, surgical procedures, or both.  Pain relievers tend not to be very effective at controlling neuralgia pain. Medications that can treat the underlying causes of neuralgia include:  Some surgical procedures can help relieve neuralgia pain when the condition does not respond to medication.  Examples of  surgical procedures  that can help treat neuralgia include:  Neuralgia causes painful symptoms that vary in duration and severity. As well as pain, neuralgia can cause numbness, muscle weakness, and hypersensitivity.  If a person does not receive treatment, neuralgia can interfere with their ability to perform daily tasks.  People can work with a healthcare provider to establish the best course of treatment for their specific symptoms. If the condition does not respond to initial treatments, a healthcare provider may refer the person to a pain management specialist.
