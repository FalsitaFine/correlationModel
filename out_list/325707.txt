 Coughing can cause a person to lean forward slightly. This position can put  stress  on the lower back and may displace the vertebrae, or spinal bones, making lower  back pain  worse.  In this article, we cover some of the possible causes of lower back pain when coughing, as well as treatment options and when to see a doctor.  Below are some of the most common causes of back pain when coughing.  Between the spinal bones are protective disks that cushion the spine and act as shock absorbers. Due to normal wear and tear, these disks can slip out of place or protrude. Doctors call this disk herniation.  An article in the   European Spine Journal   reported that people with severe  sciatica  were more likely to have disk herniation if their  leg pain  became worse when coughing.  Sciatica is pain that results from the irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve.  Sometimes, a  herniated disk  presses on the nerve roots that make up the sciatic nerve in the lower back and legs.  Disk herniation can cause tingling and numbness down the lower back and in one or both legs. Severe disk herniation can lead to symptoms such as  incontinence  of the bowel or bladder.  To relieve the pain of disk herniation, a person can try resting the back, taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), and applying a cloth-covered ice pack for 10 minutes several times per day.  In severe cases, a person may need surgery to repair the herniated disk.   Learn more about disk herniation here .  Sometimes, a bout of intense or sudden coughing can put unexpected pressure on the back. This pressure can lead to a temporary injury, such as a muscle strain, which doctors may refer to as a pulled muscle.  The pain can become more intense with certain positions or activities, including coughing. A person may also experience back stiffness, muscle spasms, or muscle tenderness.  Taking NSAIDs, resting the back for a day or two, avoiding postures and positions that worsen the pain, and applying a cloth-covered ice pack to the affected area can all help promote recovery.  If the symptoms do not subside within 4â€“6 weeks, however, a person should see their doctor.   Learn more about strains and sprains, including the differences between them, here .  As a person ages, their spinal column starts to narrow, and this can put more pressure on the spinal nerves.  Being in certain positions, such as leaning forward when coughing, can put even more pressure on the nerves and cause lower back pain.  Spinal stenosis can also cause  numbness or cramping pain  in the lower back and legs. It may also affect sexual function, cause problems with bowel or bladder function, and, in severe cases, lead to loss of leg function.  To reduce the effects of spinal stenosis, a person can try exercising to build up the muscles in the back to help support and strengthen it.  It may also help to take NSAIDs or prescription medications to relieve muscle spasms. Some doctors may recommend steroid injections and possibly even surgery if the symptoms are severe.   Lung cancer  is a rare but possible cause of lower back pain when coughing. Experiencing bone pain can indicate that the condition has spread to nearby organs.  Some  other symptoms of lung cancer  include:  The treatment options for lung cancer depend on the severity of the condition. Typical treatments include radiation and  chemotherapy  to shrink the  tumor  and surgery to remove it.   Learn more about lung cancer, including the different stages, here .  A person can try several home remedies to help improve their lower back pain. The following techniques may help:  Some people have also found relief from lower back pain by trying  alternative therapies , such as massage and  acupuncture .  A person should seek emergency medical care if they experience any symptoms that indicate that they may have severe nerve compression or illness. Such symptoms include:  These symptoms may require emergency  antibiotic  treatment or even surgery to relieve nerve compression.  Other symptoms that indicate that a person should visit a doctor include:  A doctor may recommend seeing a specialist if symptoms persist.  Experiencing lower back pain when coughing may not happen often. However, if it is a common occurrence, it may indicate the presence of an underlying health condition.  If symptoms persist or are severe, a person should seek medical attention.  A variety of home remedies and medical treatments are available to help relieve lower back pain.
