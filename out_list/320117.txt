  ADHD  (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a condition that includes a combination of persistent behavioral symptoms, such as attention difficulties, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.  ADHD affects around  11 percent  of children aged between 4 and 17 years in the United States and often continues into adulthood.  Children with ADHD may struggle with poor performance at school, low self-esteem, and have trouble with relationships. Adults with ADHD may have problems with organization and prioritizing, time management, and multitasking. They may also experience difficulties with focusing, frustration, mood swings, and coping with  stress .  Although there is no cure for ADHD, treatments can help to reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Treatments often include education, training, psychological counseling, and medications.  ADHD blogs can provide strategies, recommendations, and suggestions for coping with daily tasks from both experts and those with the disorder, wirth the aim of empowering their readers.
