 In mild cases, people can treat  scoliosis  with specific exercises and stretches alone, eliminating the need for surgery.  While some medical conditions can cause scoliosis, the most typical form of scoliosis is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This form of scoliosis develops while a person is still growing and  affects 2–3%  of the population.  While  research  has found evidence supporting specific exercises for scoliosis, it is a good idea for a person with scoliosis to speak to a doctor or physical therapist about the best stretches and exercises for them.  The correct scoliosis exercises depend on the location of the scoliosis curve. People with lumbar scoliosis should focus on exercising the lower back, while those with thoracic scoliosis need to exercise the shoulders.  Doctors may recommend the following exercises and stretches for people with scoliosis:  A pelvic tilt will help stretch tight muscles in the hips and lower back. To do a pelvic tilt:  People can strengthen their lower back with arm and leg raises. To do the raises:  The Cat-Camel is a  yoga  pose. It can help keep the spine flexible and pain-free. To do the Cat-Camel pose:  The Bird-Dog is another yoga-inspired exercise. To do this exercise:  People can stretch the latissimus dorsi — the largest muscle in the upper body — with this stretch. Thoracic scoliosis directly affects these muscles. Lumbar scoliosis can also cause back tension that extends up to the latissimus dorsi.  To do a latissimus dorsi stretch:  Having strong abdominal muscles can help take some of the pressure off of the back muscle. It can also help a person maintain good posture.  To do an abdominal press:  Good posture can reduce pain and muscle tension. Several times a day, a person can realign their body to help them learn to stand with good posture naturally.  To have a good posture when standing:  When sitting, keep the back straight and the ears over the shoulders. The legs should be in a neutral position and not crossed.  It can help to scan the body for signs of tension. For example, some people unconsciously tense their shoulders or lean slightly to one side, especially when they are in pain or under  stress .   Doctors and researchers  have developed several targeted scoliosis programs. For example, the  Scientific Exercises Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS)  is an individualized program that teaches a person to steadily correct movement issues and change the position of their spine.  The most suitable exercise program depends on the type and degree of scoliosis. If a doctor recommends a specific exercise program, ask if it is safe to do other home exercises and what exercises to avoid.  Some activities and exercises can make scoliosis symptoms worse or increase the risk of secondary injuries. People with scoliosis should avoid:  In addition to exercise, a range of home management solutions may help. These include:  Scoliosis ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, observation and home exercises are sufficient to correct a spinal curve.  In more severe cases, a person may need additional treatment, including bracing, surgery, and  physical therapy .  Because scoliosis can affect a person's mobility and their overall well-being, it is vital to see a scoliosis expert before deciding on a treatment course.
