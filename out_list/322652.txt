  Anxiety  is a widespread condition, affecting millions of people globally. Symptoms vary, and some people only experience them now and then. However, someone who experiences symptoms for 6 months or longer may have a  generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) .  The symptoms of GAD include psychological and physical symptoms, such as:  Doctors often treat GAD with a combination of treatments, including talking therapies, such as  cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT), alongside medications. Sometimes, these conventional treatments do not work long-term. However, some research suggests that proper  nutrition  can help improve symptoms.  Brazil nuts are high in  selenium .  Selenium  may improve mood by  reducing inflammation , which is often at heightened levels when someone has a mood disorder, such as anxiety.   Selenium  is also an  antioxidant , which helps prevent cell damage. It is also anti-carcinogenic, which helps to prevent  cancer  from developing.  Other nuts, animal products, and vegetables, such as mushrooms and soybeans, are an excellent source of selenium.  It is important not to consume too much selenium as it can cause side effects. The recommended upper limit for selenium for an adult is  400 micrograms  (mcg) per day. So be careful not to take supplements with high doses or eat more than a three to four Brazil nuts a day.  Brazil nuts and other nuts are also a good source of  vitamin  E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant. Antioxidants can be beneficial for treating anxiety, while  some research  has shown that low levels of vitamin E may lead to  depression  in some people.  Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout, and herring, are high in  omega-3 . Omega-3 is a fatty acid that has a strong relationship with cognitive function as well as  mental health .  However,  recent research  has shown that if a person eats too much of another fatty acid, called omega-6, and not enough omega-3, they may increase their risk of developing mood disorders, such as anxiety.  Omega-3-rich foods that contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) provides two essential  fatty acids : eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  EPA and DHA regulate neurotransmitters, reduce  inflammation , and promote healthy brain function.  A  small study  on 24 people with substance abuse problems found that EPA and DHA supplementation resulted in reduced levels of anxiety. However, more research is required.  Current recommendations suggest eating at least  two servings  of fatty fish a week. A  study  conducted on men found eating salmon three times a week reduced self-reported anxiety.  Salmon and sardines are also among the few foods that contain  vitamin D .   Vitamin D   Researchers are increasingly linking vitamin D deficiency to mood disorders, such as  depression  and anxiety. A report in the   Journal of Affective Disorders   believes that there is enough evidence to prove that vitamin D positively helps depression. Other studies on  pregnant  women and  older  adults have also highlighted how vitamin D might improve mood. Vitamin D may also improve seasonal disaffected disorder (SAD) during winter.  Egg  yolks  are another great source of vitamin D.  Eggs are also an excellent source of protein. It is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids the body needs for growth and development.  Eggs also contain  tryptophan , which is an amino acid that helps create  serotonin . Serotonin is a chemical neurotransmitter that helps to regulate mood, sleep, memory, and behavior. Serotonin is also thought to improve brain function and relieve anxiety.   Pumpkin seeds  are an excellent source of  potassium , which helps  regulate  electrolyte balance and manage  blood pressure .  Eating potassium-rich foods such, as  pumpkin  seeds or  bananas , may help reduce symptoms of  stress  and anxiety.  Pumpkin seeds are also a good source of the mineral zinc. One study carried out on 100 female high school students found that zinc deficiency may negatively affect mood.  Zinc is essential for brain and nerve development. The largest storage sites of zinc in the body are in the brain regions involved with emotions.  Experts have long suspected that dark chocolate might help reduce stress and anxiety. A  2014 study  found that 40g of dark chocolate helped reduce perceived stress in female students.  Other  studies  have generally found that dark chocolate or cocoa may improve mood. However, many of these studies are observational, so the results need to be interpreted with caution.  Although it is still unclear how dark chocolate reduces stress, it is a rich source of polyphenols, especially flavonoids.  One study  suggested that  flavonoids  might reduce neuroinflammation and cell death in the brain as well as improve blood flow.  Chocolate has a high tryptophan content, which the body uses to turn into mood-enhancing  neurotransmitters , such as serotonin in the brain.  Dark chocolate is also a good source of  magnesium . Eating a diet with enough magnesium in it or  taking supplements  may reduce symptoms of depression.  When choosing dark chocolate, aim for 70 percent or more. Dark chocolate still contains added sugars and fats, so a small serving of 1 to 3 grams (g) is appropriate.  Turmeric is a spice commonly used in Indian and South-East Asian cooking. The active ingredient in turmeric is called curcumin. Curcumin may help lower anxiety by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress that often increase in people experiencing mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression. A  2015 study  found that curcumin reduced anxiety in obese adults.  Another  study  found that an increase of curcumin in the diet also increased DHA and reduced anxiety. Turmeric is easy to add to meals. It has minimal flavor, so goes well in smoothies, curries, and casserole dishes.  Many people around the world use chamomile tea as an herbal remedy because of its  anti-inflammatory , antibacterial, antioxidant, and relaxant properties.  Some people believe that the relaxant and anti-anxiety properties come from the flavonoids present in chamomile. A recent  study  found that chamomile did reduce anxiety symptoms. However, it did not prevent new episodes of anxiety.  Chamomile tea may be useful in managing anxiety. It is readily available and safe to use in high doses.  Yogurt contains healthful bacteria,  Lactobaccilus  and  Bifidobacteria . There is emerging  evidence  that these bacteria and fermented products have positive effects on brain health.  According to a recent  clinical review , yogurt and other dairy products may also produce an anti-inflammatory effect in the body. Some research suggests that chronic inflammation may be partly responsible for anxiety, stress, and depression.  A 2015  study  found fermented foods reduced social anxiety in some young people, while  multiple studies  found consuming healthful bacteria increased happiness in some people.  Including yogurt and other fermented food in the diet can benefit the natural gut bacteria and may reduce anxiety and stress.  Fermented foods include cheese, sauerkraut, kimchi, and fermented soy products.   Green tea  contains an amino acid called  theanine , which is receiving increasing scrutiny due to its potential effects on mood disorders. Theanine has anti-anxiety and calming effects and may increase the production of serotonin and dopamine.  A  2017 review  found that 200 mg of theanine improved self-reported relaxation and calmness while reducing tension in human trials.  Green tea is easy to add to the day-to-day diet. It is a suitable replacement for soft drinks,  coffee , and alcoholic beverages.  Eat a varied and balanced diet with high quality, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates , fats, and proteins.  Aim for whole foods, vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, lean meats, and especially fish. Other foods that may help include:  Evidence increasingly shows that diets high in processed foods can increase anxiety.  If experiencing anxiety and stress, it is always best to seek out a specialist, such as a psychologist.  Sometimes, a doctor or psychologist may recommend talking therapy or CBT to manage anxiety and stress. They may also prescribe medications, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or benzodiazepines.  Eating a healthful diet should provide all the nutrients needed for healthy brain function.  A healthful diet that contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, as well as vitamins and minerals might help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.  Reducing foods that are high in added sugar, salt, and fats especially trans fats may help also help reduce inflammation. Reduce alcohol, sugar, and coffee as these may increase episodes of anxiety and the associated symptoms.  One report states that participating in  enjoyable physical activity  may also have a positive effect on mental health.  Some of the foods listed in this article are available for purchase online.
