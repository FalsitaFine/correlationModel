  Dry socket , or alveolar osteitis, can last for  up to 7 days . It is a common complication of  wisdom tooth extraction . If food particles enter the socket, they can exacerbate the pain, increase the risk of infection, and slow down the healing.  Following a tooth extraction, a blood clot usually develops over the extraction site to protect the bones and nerves underneath. In cases of dry socket, this blood clot fails to form, or it falls off before the wound heals.  In this article, we list treatments for dry socket and possible methods of prevention.  According to the  Canadian Dental Association , dry socket typically occurs within 3–5 days of the extraction and lasts for up to 7 days.  The pain is severe and can persist for 24–72 hours. The research recommends that further investigation takes place if pain continues beyond this timeframe.  Dry socket is not very common. Columbia University College of Dental Medicine estimate that it occurs in approximately  2–5%  of cases of tooth removal.  If symptoms do not appear within a few days of the extraction, it is unlikely that a person will develop a dry socket. A review in the   International Journal of Dentistry   indicates that people report 95–100% of all cases within a week.  Over-the-counter (OTC) or home remedies are not often enough to treat the pain of dry socket. People with the condition must usually see their dentist for treatment.  Sometimes multiple dental visits are necessary. Research into the condition suggests that approximately  45% of people  with dry socket need to see their dentist several times to manage the condition.  The pain should begin to reduce following treatment and should go away within a few days. If not, a dentist may do further investigations to rule out complications.  Treatments for dry socket include:  The dentist will flush out the socket with a saline solution or other fluid that helps clean wounds. This will remove food particles or germs that may be causing pain or infection.  Packing the socket with a medicated gauze dressing can provide fast pain relief.  Depending on the severity of the symptoms, it may be necessary to change the dressing several times.  It is essential to manage the pain until the dry socket heals. Many people will require prescription medication to provide enough pain relief. If symptoms are mild, OTC painkillers may work.  People should discuss the available pain relief options with their dentist.   Antibiotic  medication may be necessary if an infection develops in the socket and begins to spread to other areas of the mouth.  Signs of an infection include:  In addition to dental treatment, home remedies can provide further relief. Self-care and home remedies include:  Certain steps can help people to reduce their risk of developing a dry socket. Tips for prevention include:  Dentists recommend this before as well as after the extraction. Some  research  found that a dry socket occurred in 12% of smokers but only 4% of nonsmokers.  Some OTC or prescription medications may reduce blood clotting. Others, such as oral contraceptives, can affect the healing process and  increase the risk  of dry socket.  It can be helpful to drink plenty of water after a tooth extraction. Eating soft foods for the first 24 hours can also reduce the risk of irritating the extraction site.  People should avoid alcohol, caffeine, or carbonated drinks. They should also avoid using a straw, as these can dislodge a blood clot in the socket.  People should follow the dentist's instructions on when to rest and when to resume normal activities and exercises.  Poor oral hygiene or failure to look after the wound after having an extraction can increase dry socket risk.  Similarly, the development of a gum infection can increase the chances. Proper dental hygiene reduces the likelihood of a gum infection.  A dentist can also take steps to prevent dry socket. Examples include:   Prescribing oral antibiotics before the procedure   Some  research  suggests that antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of a dry socket in molar extractions. However, the use of antibiotics as a preventive measure is controversial.  Nonetheless, they may be necessary for some people, such as those with a compromised immune system.   Using antibacterial agents   Using an antibacterial mouthwash or gel before and after surgery  can reduce  the risk of dry socket.  Similarly, applying an antiseptic solution or dressing after surgery may help.  A dry socket is a relatively uncommon complication of tooth extraction. When it does occur, it can be extremely painful. However, a dentist can treat the condition to reduce pain and prevent complications, such as infection.  With treatment, dry socket typically only lasts a few days. During this time, home care strategies can help people to alleviate discomfort and encourage healing.
