Thrombosed hemorrhoids can affect anyone and are not a sign of being unhealthy. This article explores the symptoms, causes, and outlook for this common condition.  A person's anal canal is lined with blood vessels. When these blood vessels become dilated or swollen, they can form a hemorrhoid.  Hemorrhoids can be on the inside of the anal passage or form on the outside of the anus.

If a thrombectomy is not effective, surgery may be required. There is a variety of surgical options available. These include:  Some home treatments may reduce the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids:  It is not always possible to prevent hemorrhoids, but the following tips can reduce the risk:  Thrombosed hemorrhoids can be itchy, painful, and uncomfortable if left untreated, but symptoms can often be relieved using home remedies.
