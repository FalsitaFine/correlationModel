 IP describes how easily substances such as food, nutrients, and bacteria can pass through the intestinal wall.  The intestinal wall consists of epithelial cells. Tiny gaps between these cells allow water, ions, and other nutrients to flow from the intestines into the bloodstream. Usually, food and waste particles cannot pass through these gaps.  In leaky gut syndrome, however,  inflammation  and bacterial imbalances in the gut cause these gaps to expand. This allows harmful substances to leak into the bloodstream.  In fact, a  2016 review article  suggests that there is a close relationship between concentrations of intestinal bacteria, inflammation, and IP. Importantly, diet and  nutrition  may influence these factors.  This article discusses leaky gut syndrome and the foods that may affect it. We also provide a brief meal plan that incorporates foods to eat for improved digestive health.  According to a  2018 review , having a low biodiversity of gut bacteria may lead to increased IP and inflammation.  It may even increase the risk of several conditions, including  inflammatory bowel disease  and  obesity .  So, people may benefit from adopting a diet that increases the diversity of bacteria within the gut. This is likely to involve incorporating more  prebiotic  and  probiotic  foods that support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.  Examples of such foods include:  Other foods that may improve gut health include:  People who experience unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms may want to avoid eating foods that are difficult to digest. Experts refer to these foods as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs).  FODMAPs are short chain  carbohydrates , which bacteria break down, or ferment. This fermentation process results in the production of gas, which causes uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating and  flatulence .  Examples of FODMAPs include:  Adopting a low FODMAP diet may  reduce  gas production. This, in turn, may help alleviate the digestive discomfort that leaky gut syndrome brings.  High FODMAP foods to avoid include:  This section covers a few simple meal ideas for improving gut health.  Some people may find that certain foods trigger symptoms more than others.  People can use a food journal to track their dietary habits and symptoms and identify potential trigger foods.  Some experts have suggested that the protein zonulin could play an important role in leaky gut. This is because  zonulin  regulates the size of the gaps between epithelial cells.  A  2019 study  saw higher zonulin levels in the bodies of people with  irritable bowel syndrome  compared with people who did not have the condition.  Also, a  2018 study  found that women with high zonulin levels showed lower concentrations of beneficial gut bacteria than women with low zonulin levels. These beneficial bacteria appear to reduce gut permeability and intestinal inflammation.  Women with low zonulin levels also tended to consume diets higher in  calories , carbohydrates, protein, and salt. Although these associations were minor, the researchers suggest that diet may influence gut bacteria, IP, and overall digestive health.  Leaky gut syndrome, or increased IP, can cause uncomfortable symptoms, such as  constipation ,  diarrhea , and bloating.  People who think that they may have leaky gut syndrome can try making dietary changes to manage their symptoms.  Not everyone responds in the same way to different foods. People can try keeping a food diary to identify foods that trigger leaky gut symptoms.  People should consider seeing a doctor if their symptoms do not improve despite incorporating the above dietary changes.
