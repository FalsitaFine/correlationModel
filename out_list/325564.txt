 Irritability is a common emotion. Many factors can cause or contribute to irritability, including life  stress , a lack of sleep, low blood sugar levels, and hormonal changes.  Extreme irritability, or feeling irritable for an extended period, can sometimes indicate an underlying condition, such as an infection or  diabetes . It may also be a sign of a  mental health  condition, such as  anxiety  or  depression .  People may experience the following symptoms along with increased irritability:  In this article, we look at what can cause irritability in adults and children and provide tips for managing irritability.  Going through a stressful period can make a person feel more irritable than usual.  When someone experiences a stressful life event — which may tie in with work, school, trauma, or grief — they may find it more difficult to manage their emotions and can become overwhelmed. They may feel less tolerant of the people around them.  Feeling overwhelmed by life stress is normal, but prolonged periods of stress can lead to  emotional exhaustion . Recognizing the early signs of stress and taking steps to relieve this feeling can help people avoid burnout.  The  National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)  provide useful tips for coping with life stress.  Depression affects nearly  16 million adults  in the United States. It can manifest in a wide range of symptoms and often causes persistent sadness,  fatigue , and irritability.  One of the early  signs of depression  or a  depression relapse  is stronger feelings of irritability.  Irritability is more likely to be one of the  symptoms of depression in men  than in women, and it often occurs alongside aggressive feelings, risk-taking, and substance abuse.  The  National Institute of Mental Health  state that people may have depression if they experience any of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks:  Not everyone experiences every symptom of depression. Symptoms can vary in severity and duration.  Feelings of anxiety often arise in response to stressful situations in life, such as problems at work, preparing for an important exam, or going through significant life changes. This type of anxiety usually goes away once the stressful situation passes.  However, anxiety may linger or worsen over time and can severely affect a person's daily activities, work performance, and personal relationships.  If a person has excessive anxiety or worry that lasts for  6 months or longer , they may have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which affects up to  20% of adults  in the U.S. each year.  The symptoms of GAD can occur in other types of anxiety disorder and may include:  People may also experience  panic attacks . A panic attack refers to a period of intense fear that develops with little to no warning and peaks  within minutes . The exact triggers vary from person to person, and they may not always be apparent.  People who experience panic attacks may find themselves worrying about when the next attack will occur. They might go out of their way to avoid situations, places, or behaviors that could trigger an attack. Thinking about triggers and panic attacks can make a person feel overwhelmed and irritable.  The term  phobia  describes an intense fear or aversion to a certain object, person, or situation.  Thinking about or having exposure to the phobic situation or item can make a person feel overwhelmed, panicky, and more irritable than usual.  People who have a phobia disorder may feel intense fear or anxiety about:  Not getting enough sleep, or  sleep deprivation , can make a person feel irritable the next day. Children are especially likely to be unusually irritable or emotional if they have not had enough good quality sleep.  If a person feels tired all of the time or finds that sleeping does not make them feel refreshed, they may have a sleep disorder that causes them to  wake up regularly at night , such as  insomnia  or  sleep apnea .  The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  state that one in three adults do not get enough sleep. They recommend that adults get at least 7 hours of sleep per night. Teenagers  should get  8–10 hours per night, while babies may need up to 16 hours.  Getting enough good quality sleep is  important for health . It plays a role in boosting mental performance, concentration, and immune system function, and it also reduces the risk of  heart disease  and depression.  People can boost their quality of sleep by adopting the following practices to improve their sleep hygiene:   Read more tips for better sleep here.   Having low blood sugar, called  hypoglycemia , can affect a person's physical and psychological health. Low blood sugar commonly affects people with diabetes as a result of them using  insulin  and other diabetes medications.  However, people with or without diabetes can experience temporary hypoglycemia if they have not eaten for several hours.  The  symptoms of hypoglycemia  include:  Hypoglycemia can also affect a person's sleep. People can experience nightmares and excessive sweating throughout the night.  Hormonal imbalances can cause various physical and psychological symptoms, including irritability. High levels of stress, poor  nutrition , and inadequate sleep can influence people's hormones.  Other possible causes of hormonal imbalance include:  Low levels of  testosterone  or high levels of  estrogen  can cause irritability in males.   Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  is an example of a common hormonal imbalance that can result in mood swings and irritability.  PMS is very common, with  over 90%  of people reporting PMS symptoms in the week or fortnight before their period.  Other common symptoms of PMS include:  If a person experiences severe irritability, depression, or anxiety in the lead up to their period, they may have  premenstrual dysphoric disorder  (PMDD). This condition affects up to  5%  of females of childbearing age. A doctor can provide information on treatment options for PMDD.  Young children go through phases of appearing more or less irritable. These phases are a normal part of development.  Children often seem irritable if they have a viral or bacterial infection. This irritability will usually go away when they feel better.  In other cases, irritability in children and adolescents  can indicate  a mood or behavior disorder, such as:  Mood and behavior disorders are relatively common. According to a  2019 study  on mood and behavior disorders in children aged 3–17 years:  The causes of irritability in older adults are the same as those in younger adults, although there is an increased likelihood of mood swings, depression, and irritability having an association with physical pain, isolation, loneliness, or an underlying medical condition.  The  National Institute on Aging  list mood changes, personality changes, and increased agitation as early signs of  Alzheimer's disease , the most common form of  dementia .   Learn more about the early signs of dementia here.   The treatment options for irritability vary depending on the underlying cause. Effectively treating the cause will relieve feelings of irritability and other related symptoms.  Medications, such as mood stabilizers and  antidepressants , can help treat mood disorders. Professional counseling can help reduce mood-related symptoms, such as fear, worry, and irritability.  Treatments for hormonal imbalances include diet and lifestyle changes as well as hormone therapy.  Hormone therapy may not work for everyone, so it is best to consult a trained healthcare professional before starting hormone supplements.  People can manage their irritability in several different ways. Certain methods will work better for some people than others. It is up to the individual to find which coping mechanisms best suit their personality and lifestyle.

Persistent irritability may indicate an underlying physical or psychological disorder, such as:  Children may appear irritable as a normal part of development. In other cases, irritability may be due to an infection, mood disorder, or behavior disorder, such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety.  Older adults may also experience frequent periods of irritability if they feel isolated or lonely.
