 Dermatophagia is an emerging concept in  mental health  research. For this reason, there have been few studies into precisely what it is and how it differs from other conditions.  According to the  TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors , mental health specialists sometimes classify dermatophagia as an "obsessive-compulsive and related disorder."  This means that it is related to or part of  obsessive-compulsive disorder  (OCD). With this condition, a person has ongoing, uncontrollable, and recurring thoughts and behaviors.  In this article, learn more about dermatophagia, including the symptoms, possible causes, and treatment options.  A person with dermatophagia compulsively bites, gnaws, or eats their skin. This might leave their skin raw. This damage to the skin can also increase the risk of developing a skin infection.  Some experts think that dermatophagia is a body-focused repetitive behavior. Other similar behaviors include:  According to  research from 2015 , a person with an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder may experience a sense of shame due to their condition. This feeling may occur due to the diminishing stigma around mental health issues, or it may be specific to a person's symptoms.  It is not clear why some people develop dermatophagia. According to the  TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors , both genetic and social factors may have a role.  According to the  National Institute of Mental Health , people with OCD may be more likely to have family members that also have OCD. It is not clear whether this is genetic, arises from learned behaviors, or is due to a combination of these factors.  It is also not clear whether factors that affect whether a person will develop OCD also have the same role in people with dermatophagia.  Because dermatophagia is a fairly new concept in mental health research, a doctor may not necessarily be able to make a specific diagnosis.  It is more likely that a doctor would diagnose or classify this under another related condition, such as OCD.  According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , diagnosing OCD is complex. A doctor will only make a diagnosis if:  The treatment a doctor suggests will depend on the suspected causes of the dermatophagia.  If a doctor thinks a person's dermatophagia is a type of OCD, they may suggest behavioral therapy, medication, or a combination of the two.   Research  suggests that  cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT) can be an effective way of treating OCD and conditions related to it.  However, a doctor may also think that dermatophagia is explainable by something other than OCD. In this case, they will likely suggest a different treatment plan.  Long-term management will depend on what causes dermatophagia and how well treatment methods work.  It could be that CBT gives a person the skills to reduce the symptoms of dermatophagia, or they may need medication to help them control the condition.  If another underlying mental health condition is causing dermatophagia, a doctor will aim to treat that first.  As dermatophagia is an emerging concept in mental health research, a person's outlook will depend on what a doctor thinks the key causes are.  In any case, a medical professional is best placed to help a person work out why they have dermatophagia and help them treat the condition.
