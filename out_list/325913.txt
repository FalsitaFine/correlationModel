 The ribs are flexible bones that make up the rib cage. These bones protect important organs in the chest, including the heart, lungs, and spleen.  It is essential to have a doctor assess any rib injury to ensure that it is not severe and has not damaged internal organs.  Symptoms of a bruised rib  include :  The skin at the site of the injury may bruise as a result of ruptured blood vessels. When these vessels rupture, blood can pool in surrounding tissues.  However, the bones may bruise  without any visible injury  or bruising on the skin.  The most common cause of a bruised rib is  trauma to the chest .  This trauma can result from falls, sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, crush injuries, or assaults, for example. People with  osteoporosis  can  fracture  a rib by having a violent coughing episode.  Trauma to the ribs or chest can also cause soft tissue injuries involving the muscles and cartilage. For example, forceful twisting or coughing can  strain or pull  the intercostal muscles, which allow for the flexibility of the rib cage.  Also, pregnant women can be  more susceptible to rib fracture and injury , particularly in the third trimester, due to the growing uterus.  To diagnose a bruised rib or rib fracture, a doctor will take detailed notes about the injury and the aftermath, including the person's symptoms.  They will also perform a physical examination to assess the site of the injury and listen to the heart and lungs. Evaluating a person's breathing is essential.  The doctor may perform a chest X-ray with emphasis on rib detail to see if a rib bone is broken. However, bruising does not always show up on X-rays.  A person might undergo other tests to differentiate a fracture from a muscle or soft tissue injury.  Doctors do not treat bruised or broken ribs in the same manner as a broken arm or leg because rib bones cannot be cast or splinted.  Doctors typically leave bruised or broken ribs to heal on their own. However, in special circumstances, such as when there are multiple fractures or breaks in the rib cage, doctors recommend  surgical intervention .  Otherwise, the primary goal of treatment for a bruised or broken rib is  pain relief .  If the pain is severe, a person may not be able to breathe as deeply, which can cause a buildup of mucus in the lungs.  Ways to  treat bruised and fractured ribs  at home include:  A person can try  gently stretching  the muscles in the shoulders and chest wall, but it is important to avoid movements that make the pain worse.  Usually, rib injuries heal on their own. Bruised and broken ribs heal in a similar way and typically get better within  3â€“6 weeks . If a person is not feeling better in a few weeks, they should contact their doctor, who may request more testing.  Chest wall injuries, including bruised or broken ribs, are a  common  cause of chest pain in children. These injuries  often  result from car accidents, blows, or falls, such as on bicycle handlebars.  To promote healing from a bruised or broken rib, encourage the child to rest, use cold and hot packs, give pain relievers as directed, and suggest gentle stretching.  Contact the doctor if the child has a  fever , trouble breathing, abdominal pain, or dizziness or lightheadedness.  Consult a healthcare provider if these  symptoms  are present:  Any of these symptoms could indicate a potentially severe condition.  Also, see a doctor if there is no general improvement after a few weeks.  A bruised rib usually results from an injury such as a fall or a blow to the chest, which may happen while playing sports, for example. Rib fractures occur in the same way.  Bruised ribs are often painful, but over-the-counter pain relievers and ice packs can help.  The bruising may take several weeks to heal. If symptoms have not improved within a few weeks, contact the doctor, who may request further testing. A bruised or broken rib can sometimes affect lung health.
