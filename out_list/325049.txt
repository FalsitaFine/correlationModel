 A low-carb diet can help people with  diabetes  manage their condition or help people lose or maintain weight more effectively.  Examples of low-carb foods include:  If a diet provides fewer than  50 grams (g)  of  carbohydrates  per day, it can cause  ketosis . Ketosis is a regular metabolic process that the body performs when it does not have enough carbohydrates to use for energy, so it starts burning fat instead.  A lower intake of carbs can help reduce the amount of  insulin  that the body produces. It may also help prevent  hypertension ,  type 2 diabetes , and, possibly, some  cancers .  According to the Obesity Medicine Association, people typically consider  20â€“50 g  of carbohydrates each day to be a "moderate" low-carb diet.  Below are some examples of healthful low-carb meals for any time of day.   Total carbohydrates per serving:  10 g    Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  1 g    Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  25 g    Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  8 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  11 g    Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  34 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  30 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  10 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  9 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  8 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  4 g    Ingredients:  Preparation:   Total carbohydrates per serving:  5 g     Ingredients:  Preparation:  A low-carb diet may support overall health and help a person maintain a healthy weight. People with diabetes, for example, may find that this type of diet helps with managing the condition.  The body needs some carbs to stay healthy, however. A diet that contains too few carbohydrates can lead to nutrient deficiencies and health problems, such as  constipation  and high  cholesterol  levels.  Also, a diet that has very high levels of protein and saturated fats can cause problems for the kidneys and heart. It is essential to include a healthful balance of fruit and vegetables in any diet.  If a person is concerned about the number of carbs in their diet, or the effects of a low-carb diet on a specific health issue, they should consult their doctor or another healthcare professional.
