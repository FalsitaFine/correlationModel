 Health experts continue to debate whether or not high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is worse than other sugars. Many natural and organic health advocates argue that HFCS is more dangerous than other sugars.  The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  explain that HFCS is not more dangerous than other sugars, but research on the topic is ongoing.  HFCS is not necessary for a healthful diet. In fact, avoiding it may help a person maintain a healthful weight.  HFCS is a  very sweet derivative  of corn starch.  Starch consists of chains of glucose, which is a sugar. Breaking corn starch down into individual glucose molecules forms corn syrup.  To create HFCS, manufacturers add enzymes to corn syrup that convert some of the glucose to fructose. Fructose is the type of sugar present in fruit and is very sweet. The amount of fructose in HFCS varies, but the most common varieties contain either 42% or 55%.  As with HFCS, table sugar, or sucrose, also consists of glucose and fructose.  Research has consistently shown links between the consumption of HFCS and  obesity , metabolic dysregulation, and similar health issues.  According to a  2017 study of mice , HFCS consumption increased fasting glucose and reduced the ability of mice to clear glucose from the body. The study also found changes in dopamine signaling in the group that consumed HFCS.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that affects feelings of motivation and reward. Past research has linked impaired dopamine signaling to obesity.  Contrary to some previous studies, HFCS did not increase  body weight . This suggests that HFCS may undermine health even if it does not cause weight gain.  A  2012 analysis  of 43 countries found that rates of  diabetes  are 20% higher in those where HFCS is readily available.  Several  other studies  have linked HFCS availability to higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and  heart disease . However, this research is correlational and does not mean that HFCS directly causes these conditions. In countries where HFCS is prevalent, people might prefer sweetened foods or consume larger quantities of all types of sugar.  This is why dissecting claims about whether or not HFCS is safe is difficult. Most research suggests that HFCS availability correlates with an increase in health issues. However, HFCS availability also correlates more generally with high sugar consumption.  The  FDA  and most other public health agencies emphasize that HFCS, as with other added sugars, can increase the risk of diabetes and other health concerns.  However, there is little evidence to suggest that HFCS is inherently more harmful than other sugars.  The problem with HFCS is its prevalence. It is present in numerous foods, including those that do not taste sweet, such as pizza and crackers.  Many foods contain HFCS, so this list is by no means exhaustive.  The most common sources of this ingredient include:  HFCS is usually visible on a product's label.  Manufacturers must  list ingredients  in order from highest to lowest quantity.  This means that the first few ingredients on a label are present in the largest quantities.  So, people who want to minimize their HFCS intake should avoid any foods that list HFCS among the first few ingredients.  In  2010 , in response to increased concerns about the dangers of HFCS, the Corn Refiners Association petitioned the FDA to change the name of HFCS to corn sugar. The FDA rejected the request, citing concerns about consumer confusion.  However, it is possible that the name might change in the future.  Because HFCS is not the only sugar that can cause health problems, it is important to also look for other sugars. Sugar goes by at least  61 names  on  nutrition  labels, including:  The  American Heart Association (AHA)  recommend that men consume no more than 150  calories  of added sugar per day. This is equivalent to 9 teaspoons, or 36 grams (g). Women should restrict their intake of added sugar to no more than 100 calories per day, which is equivalent to 6 teaspoons, or 25 g.  The debate regarding the risks of HFCS continues. As with other sugars, there is no need to include HFCS in a healthful diet. In fact, its inclusion may increase the risk of numerous health issues.  Limiting HFCS consumption can help a person reduce their sugar intake, potentially supporting their weight loss or health goals.  People who want to limit their HFCS intake may feel frustrated by the abundance of food that contains HFCS. People who cannot eliminate HFCS from their diet can still reap health benefits by reducing consumption.  They can achieve this by limiting soda intake and eating fewer processed snacks.
