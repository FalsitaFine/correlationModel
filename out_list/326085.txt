 Several clues can help a healthcare professional determine the cause of rectal pain.  For instance, determining when the pain occurs — such as when sitting or during a bowel movement — and uncovering any additional symptoms can help narrow down the cause.  Other common symptoms include itching, stinging, bleeding, and stomach cramps.  Rectal pain has a wide variety of causes, from minor to serious. Because pain around the rectum has so many possible sources, it is important to get a proper diagnosis.  Causes of rectal pain include the following:   Hemorrhoids  are veins in the anus that have swollen up.  They may develop on the inside or outside of the rectum.  Hemorrhoids are a common cause of rectal discomfort, especially if they are on the inside.  According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,  about 50%  of adults over the age of 50 develop hemorrhoids.  The veins in the anus may swell more often when a person has trouble having a bowel movement and pushes forcefully. Pushing during childbirth also increases a person's risk of developing hemorrhoids.  Along with rectal pain, hemorrhoids may cause additional symptoms, including:  An  anal fissure  is a small cut or tear in the skin that lines the rectal opening.  They usually develop due to stretching or straining the tissue at the opening of the rectum. Similar to hemorrhoids, anal fissures occur as a result of bearing down during childbirth or passing a hard stool.  Other symptoms of an anal fissure include:  Like all muscles, those around the rectum may spasm, and this can cause pain.  Rectal spasms may only last a few seconds or several minutes. Brief rectal spasms are called  proctalgia fugax .  Certain things may trigger a spasm, such as having a bowel movement, sexual activity, or  constipation . Spasms may also occur for no known reason.   Some research suggests  that proctalgia is common and may occur in up to about 18% of the population. Proctalgia most often develops in adults ages 30–60, and it is more common in women.  Levator ani syndrome is a variation of proctalgia fugax. It involves spasms and rectal pain that may last for as long as 20 minutes. Other symptoms of rectal spasms include:   Fecal impaction  is a hard stool that is stuck in the rectum. Chronic constipation is the most frequent cause of fecal impaction.  Other symptoms of fecal impaction may include:  Certain bowel conditions can cause  inflammation  in the intestines, including the rectum.  According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , both ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease  can cause pain in the lower intestinal tract.  Other symptoms of these bowel conditions include:  Although not as common as other causes,  sexually transmitted infections  (STIs) can spread to the rectum from the genitals and cause pain. Various types of STIs can spread, including  human papillomavirus ,  herpes , and  chlamydia .  Other symptoms of STIs affecting the rectum may include:  A rectal prolapse occurs when part or all of the rectum slides out through the anal opening.  The condition is not common, and the cause is not clear. However,  up to 67%  of people who experience a rectal prolapse have long term constipation. It is also much more common in women over the age of 50.  Other symptoms of rectal prolapse include:  The skin around the rectum is very sensitive. Friction from sexual activity involving the anus can cause small tears, irritation, swelling, or bleeding. This is partly because the anus does not produce its own lubrication.  Anal sex is mostly safe. If a person experiences pain during or after anal sex, they can try using foreplay and plenty of lubricant to prevent pain in future.

Bacteria may get into the cavities, causing an infection.  Other symptoms of a rectal abscess may include:  Inflammation of the lining of the rectum develops most often from bowel disease. In addition to rectal discomfort, other symptoms of inflammation around the rectal lining may include:  Rectal or  anal cancer  can also cause rectal discomfort. However, most cases of rectal pain are not due to  cancer .  Still, it is important to recognize other signs of rectal cancer, including:  The treatment options for rectal pain usually depend on the cause.  For example, treatment for fecal impaction may include a medical procedure to remove the impacted stool. Treatment for STIs often involves medications.  To relieve general rectal pain, people can try:  Rectal pain often goes away quickly without needing to see a healthcare provider. However, there are instances when it is important to see a doctor.  Consider visiting a healthcare provider if:  Rectal pain might occur briefly and usually does not indicate a serious condition, especially when it only happens occasionally.  However, there are times when it is a symptom of something more serious, such as inflammatory bowel disease or an STI.  Although many cases of rectal pain are treatable with home remedies, it may be necessary to see a doctor in some instances, such as if rectal pain worsens or does not go away.  Anyone who develops rectal pain and is concerned should see their healthcare provider.
