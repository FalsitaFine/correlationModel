 The pain of a stubbed toe usually subsides after a few minutes. In some cases, however, the impact could break the toe or the toenail, causing intense pain that may get worse over hours or days.  In most cases, people can treat the injury at home and medication can help with the pain.  This article looks at the symptoms of a stubbed toe, how to tell if a toe is broken or sprained, some treatments, and a range of home remedies.  A stubbed toe is the name for any injury that happens when a person suddenly hits or jams their toe.  Some common causes include accidentally kicking the toe into a wall or doorframe, tripping over a toy on the floor, or catching the toe on a gate or other object.  The symptoms of a stubbed toe are similar at first, regardless of whether the injury is serious or minor. They include:  Stubbed toes can hurt a lot, even when the injury is not serious. This is because there are many nerves in the toe, including two nerves on either side.  There is little fat to cushion the toes, which can intensify the pain and increase the risk of injuries such as bone bruises and  fractures .  It can be difficult to self-diagnose a stubbed toe. Strains, sprains, bone contusions, and broken toes can all feel very similar.  If symptoms do not improve after a few minutes, it may mean that the toe is broken.  Stubbing the toe can result in several different injuries:  A broken toe or a toe fracture is a break in one of the  14 toe bones . It can be very painful and make it difficult to walk.  Although many fractures heal on their own, a doctor may need to surgically repair a severe fracture.  Symptoms of a broken toe  include :  The symptoms of a bone bruise, strain, and sprain are similar to those of a broken toe.  A sprain is an injury to the ligaments that connect the bones of the toe. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon.  Mild strains and sprains may just stretch a ligament, muscle, or tendon. However, more severe injuries can tear the tissue.

They can be intensely painful, but they will usually heal within a couple of months. A bone bruise does not show up on an X-ray.  Injuries to the toenails can be very painful, especially if the toenail breaks deep in the nail plate. If the injury is serious enough to bleed, it may be painful to walk for several weeks.  Sometimes the toenail falls off, either right after stubbing the toe or weeks later.  People may notice the following injuries after stubbing their toe:  A  subungual hematoma  is a spot of blood under the toenail.  Severe hematomas can cause large blood spots and intense, painful pressure. Hematomas, regardless of size, often cause the toenail to fall off.  It can take  6â€“9 months  for a subungual hematoma to disappear.  If the impact from stubbing a toe causes broken skin or nails, bacteria can enter the skin to cause an infection.  If the skin is broken, it is important to keep the toe clean and covered and to see a doctor for symptoms of an infection. People with  diabetes  or a weakened immune system are more vulnerable to toe and foot infections.  Skin infections along the nail are called  paronychia .  Symptoms of an infected toe include:  After stubbing the toe, massaging or shaking the foot can distract from the pain and increase blood flow.  If the injury is more serious, a number of strategies can help with the pain:  If the injury is severe, a doctor might recommend surgery or  physical therapy .  See a doctor if:  Go to the emergency room if:  A stubbed toe can be extremely painful. Massaging or shaking the area sometimes helps. When the pain does not go away, it may mean that there is a more serious injury.  Although many toe injuries heal on their own, prompt medical care can speed healing and help with the pain.
