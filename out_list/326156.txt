 Researchers say that red meat contains important nutrients, including protein,  vitamin B-12 , and  iron . However, there is evidence to suggest that eating a lot of red meat can raise a person's risk of certain  cancers ,  heart disease , and other health concerns.  This article looks at what the research says, official dietary recommendations, and what amount of red meat might be healthful.  The focus of this article is on the health impacts of red meat. It does not address the ethical and environmental arguments around the consumption of red meat.  Specialists usually classify red meat as muscle meat from beef, pork, lamb, goat, or other land mammals.  On one hand, red meat is a good source of certain nutrients, especially  vitamin  B-12 and iron. The human body needs these nutrients to produce new red blood cells.  Red meat is also high in protein, which is necessary for building muscle, bone, other tissues, and enzymes.  However, some research has linked regular consumption of red meat to a number of health problems, such as  heart disease , some cancers,  kidney problems , digestive issues, and mortality.  To further complicate the issue, some studies suggest that the type of red meat a person eats makes the most difference.  Leaner cuts of unprocessed red meat, such as sirloin steaks or pork tenderloin, may be more healthful than other types. This is because they are unprocessed and do not contain excess salt, fat, or preservatives.  Processed red meats — including bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, salami, and similar meats — appear to carry the highest risk of health problems.  Red meat contains nutrients that are beneficial to health, including iron, vitamin B-12, and zinc.  Animal based foods, such as meat and dairy, are the main dietary sources of vitamin B-12. For this reason, people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to take supplemental B-12 in order to prevent  B-12 deficiency anemia .  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, one 3.5-ounce (oz) or 100-gram (g) serving of uncooked ground beef  contains :  Many factors can affect the nutritional value of a specific piece of meat. For example, cuts from different parts of the animal vary in their calorie and fat content. Also, the way the farmer raised the animal, the animal's diet, and even the animal's age and sex can affect the nutritional value of the meat.  The  National Institutes of Health (NIH)  list some types of red meat as good sources of heme iron. Heme iron is only present in meat, poultry, and seafood. Nonheme iron occurs in plants and iron fortified foods, such as cereals and  plant milks .  The NIH state that  heme iron is more bioavailable , which means that the body can use it more easily. Although many people get enough iron from their diets, the NIH say that certain people are at risk of iron deficiency, including:  Many different studies have suggested that eating red meat regularly can lead to a higher risk of heart disease. For years, experts have believed that the link between red meat consumption and heart disease is due to the saturated fat that is present in red meat.  The  American Heart Association (AHA)  claim that red meats generally have more saturated fat than other sources of protein, such as chicken, fish, or legumes.  They suggest that eating high amounts of saturated fat and any amount of trans fat can raise a person's  cholesterol  levels and increase their risk of heart disease. They therefore recommend that people limit the amount of red meat they eat and encourage people to choose lean cuts of meat.  That being said, red meat is not the primary source of trans fats in the Western diet. Packaged, processed, and fried foods tend to contain the most.  The AHA also explain that beans and legumes are heart-healthy alternative sources of protein. Examples include:  A meta-analysis in the journal   Circulation   looked at 36 different studies. It concluded that replacing red meat with high quality plant protein sources — but not low quality  carbohydrates  — led to "more favorable" concentrations of fat in the blood.  The meta-analysis also found that there were not significant improvements in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or  blood pressure  between the red meat and animal protein diet groups.  Other studies have questioned the notion that saturated fat has links with heart disease. The authors of  a review of heart disease risk  state that researchers have exaggerated the role of saturated fat in the development of heart disease.  Also, a team of cardiologists wrote  an article  stating that the consumption of saturated fat does not clog the arteries or increase the risk of heart disease.  Another article  says that numerous analyses and reviews do not support the notion that eating saturated fat has links with heart disease.  All things considered, there is evidence both for and against saturated fats playing a role in heart disease. Research is ongoing.  Some studies have suggested that aside from the saturated fats debate, red meat still has other potential heart disease risks.   A recent study  found that people who eat red meat regularly have higher levels of a metabolite called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Bacteria in the gut produce TMAO during digestion. It is a toxin that researchers have linked to an  increased risk  of heart disease death.  This study shows that people who ate red meat had triple the levels of TMAO compared with those who ate white meat or plant based proteins. However, their TMAO levels returned to normal around 4 weeks after stopping eating red meat.  Some recent research suggests that eating red meat regularly could increase the risk of cancer or death. The findings of specific studies vary, however.   One 2015 paper  states that red meat is "probably carcinogenic to humans," and that processed meat is "carcinogenic to humans." This is consistent with the  World Health Organization's (WHO)  classifications.  Specifically, the paper states that based on several large studies, people who ate more red meat were more likely to develop  colorectal cancer . The risk was higher for both red meat and processed meat, though processed meat seemed to raise the risk more.  The research also found a higher risk of pancreatic and  prostate cancer  in those who ate red meat. Finally, those who ate more processed meat also had a higher risk of  stomach cancer .  The authors say that meat processing methods, such as curing and smoking, can create cancer causing chemicals. This may be why researchers have linked processed meat with greater health risks than unprocessed meat.  Other research has also shown links between red meat and cancer. For example:  When a person cooks meat at a high temperature, such as by pan frying it or grilling it over an open flame, certain chemicals form in the meat. These chemicals, called heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, may cause changes in DNA that lead to cancer.  Exposure to these chemicals can cause cancer in animals, but experts do not know for certain that this also happens in humans.  The  National Cancer Institute  say that people can reduce their exposure to these chemicals by:  Serving  antioxidant  rich vegetables, such as dark leafy greens, with cooked meats is another good way to support the body.  The guidelines for how much red meat is healthful vary from organization to organization.  The  World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR)  say that if a person eats red meat, they should limit their intake to 3 servings per week. This would be equivalent to about 12–18 oz per week. They also say to eat little, "if any," processed meat.  They explain that meat can be a valuable source of nutrients, but that people do not need to eat meat — red or otherwise — to be healthy. In fact, they say that "people can obtain adequate protein from a mixture of pulses (legumes) and cereals (grains)."  The  AHA are less specific  in their meat recommendations. They say that people should cut back on meat and only eat it "once in a while," sticking to lean cuts and portions that are no larger than 6 oz.  However, not everyone agrees that people should avoid or limit red meat.   One article states  that an "overzealous focus" on limiting red meat can lead people to eat less nutritious foods, such as highly processed junk foods. Also, because researchers have linked highly processed foods  with numerous health problems , this may not be a positive trade-off.  The article also states that "unprocessed red meats are one of the best sources of high quality protein and make important contributions to nutrient intakes." They can also keep triglyceride levels lower than high carbohydrate diets do.  It is difficult to link one food or food group to health problems. This is because a range of other factors — including genetics, environment, health history,  stress  levels, sleep quality, lifestyle, and other dietary factors — may play a role in whether or not a person develops a specific condition or disease.  Still, the body of evidence claiming that eating high amounts of red meat, especially processed meat, could lead to health problems is growing.  Major health organizations, such as the  AICR  and the  AHA , suggest eating more plants and less meat to help combat disease.  For this reason, people may wish to cut back on red and processed meat and to focus on foods that contain antioxidants and nutrients — such as fruits and vegetables — that can help prevent health problems.  It is important to remember that substituting red meat for processed, low quality carbohydrates can worsen  insulin  sensitivity, triglyceride levels, and overall health.
