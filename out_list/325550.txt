 All fruit contains some natural sugar.  Very sweet fruits , including  mangoes  and watermelons, have a relatively high sugar content. Generally, however, fruit tends to contain less sugar than sweetened foods.  Almost everyone, including  people with diabetes , could benefit from  eating more fruit . This is due to the combination of  vitamins , minerals, fiber, phytochemicals, and water it provides.  Fruit contains  two types of sugar : fructose and glucose. The proportions of each vary, but most fruits are about half glucose and half fructose. Glucose raises blood sugar, so the body must use  insulin  to metabolize it. Fructose does not raise blood sugar. Instead, the liver breaks it down.  In the sections below, we look at how fruit sugars compare with other sugars, the risks associated with sugar intake, and the benefits of eating fruit.  The sugars that manufacturers most commonly use in foods include:  These sugars differ from fruit sugar because they undergo processing and manufacturers tend to overuse them as additives in food and other products. Our bodies also metabolize these sugars more quickly.  For example, sucrose can make  coffee  sweeter, and high fructose corn syrup is a common additive in many processed products, such as soda, fruit snacks and bars, and more.  Research  consistently links refined and added fructose , both of which are present in sugar and sweetened products, to a higher risk of health conditions such as  diabetes  and  heart disease .  It is worth reiterating, however, that this research looked exclusively at fructose in its processed form as an additive in sweetened foods, not at fructose from whole fruits.  Although some fad and extreme diets aim to reduce or eliminate fruit from the diet, for most people, there is no evidence to suggest that fruit is harmful.  A  2014 study  comparing fructose with glucose reviewed 20 controlled feeding trials. Although pooled analyses suggested that added fructose could raise  cholesterol , uric acid, and triglycerides, it did not have a more negative effect on lipid profile, markers for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or insulin.   People with diabetes  can also safely consume fruit. In many cases, sweet fruit can satisfy a craving for something else. Fruit has far less sugar than most sweet snacks, which can mean that a person consumes fewer  calories  and less sugar while also obtaining valuable nutrients.  Whole fruit is always a better choice than packaged or processed fruits.  For example, manufacturers tend to heavily sweeten and highly process fruit juices. Flavored juices that they market to children often contain large amounts of added sugars. These juices are not a substitute for whole fruit, and they may significantly increase a person's sugar consumption.  People who consume canned fruits should check the label, as some canned fruits contain sweeteners or other flavoring agents that can greatly increase their sugar content.  A very high intake of fruit, as with any other food, may cause a person to consume too many calories, which may increase their risk of  obesity . Overeating fruit, however, is difficult.  To exceed a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet by only eating fruit, a person would have to eat  approximately  18  bananas , 15 apples, or 44 kiwifruits each day. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, most people  eat fewer than  five servings of fruit per day.  Some of the only people  who should avoid fruit  are those with rare conditions that affect the way their bodies absorb or metabolize fructose. People with specific fruit allergies should also avoid some types of fruit.  A condition called fructose malabsorption, for instance, can cause fructose to ferment in the colon, causing stomach pain and  diarrhea . Also, a rare genetic disorder called hereditary fructose intolerance interferes with the liver's ability to metabolize fruit, which may require a person to adopt a diet without fructose.   Pregnant women in their second trimester  should try to avoid eating more than four servings of fruit per day, especially of fruits that are high on the glycemic index. They may also wish to avoid tropical fruits, as these may increase the risk of gestational diabetes.  The benefits of eating fruit far outweigh any purported or hypothetical risks. The benefits include:  Fruit consumption is so beneficial to health that a  2019 systematic review  concluded that the current recommendations might actually underestimate the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables.  Nowadays, it can be difficult to separate nutritional facts from fiction, especially for people who are eager to lose weight, live longer, and feel better.  People should talk to a doctor or dietitian before making any dramatic changes to their diet. However, for most people, it is safe and recommended to eat several servings of whole fruit per day.  People with diabetes can also enjoy fruit regularly, though low glycemic and high fiber fruits are best.
