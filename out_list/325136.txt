 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs in people with  diabetes  when the body does not make or receive enough  insulin .  In this article, learn about the causes and symptoms of DKA as well as the risk factors and treatment options.  DKA is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of sugars.  In people without diabetes, insulin helps sugar enter the cells, which use it for fuel. A person with diabetes does not make enough insulin to properly transport the sugar, which means that their body cannot use it for energy.  Without enough sugar, the liver turns some of the fat in the body into acids called ketones. Ketones build up in the bloodstream and spill over into the urine. When these excess ketones get into the blood, the blood becomes acidic, causing DKA.  DKA is a medical emergency. Anyone living with diabetes needs to learn the signs and symptoms of DKA to know when to seek urgent medical treatment.  DKA is much more likely to occur in people with  type 1 diabetes , but anyone with type 1 or  type 2 diabetes  can develop it. Those who need to take insulin have a more severe form of diabetes and, therefore, will have a higher risk of DKA.  People with type 2 diabetes who may be prone to  ketosis   include :  Diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms often start suddenly and can include:  People with diabetes who monitor their blood sugar regularly may also find that their blood sugar readings have become very high.  For others, the symptoms of DKA may be the first indication of diabetes, which may lead to a diagnosis.  Very high blood sugar levels and low levels of insulin cause diabetic ketoacidosis.  Either illness or a problem with insulin therapy can put a person at risk of having high blood sugar or low insulin, even with regular diabetes treatment.  Illness and infection alter the production of some of the body's hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine.  These hormones change how insulin works in the body and can reduce its effectiveness, which some people may need to counter by taking extra insulin while they are unwell.  Problems with prescribed insulin therapy can also cause DKA. Some issues with insulin therapy that may trigger DKA include:  Other triggers for DKA can include:  People with type 1 diabetes or those who frequently miss insulin doses have the highest risk of developing DKA. Some diabetes medications may increase the risk of DKA even when the blood sugar is not high.  When treating diabetic ketoacidosis, doctors aim to normalize blood sugar levels. They may prescribe the following treatments:  The treatment for DKA can sometimes cause complications. Possible complications include:  Due to the risk of these complications, doctors will closely monitor people with DKA in the hospital.  A person with diabetes can take many steps to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. Preventing DKA usually centers on learning how to manage diabetes well.  Preventive steps include:  Anyone who suspects that they may have DKA should be prepared to act quickly and seek emergency medical treatment.  Diabetic ketoacidosis can be a life-threatening complication of diabetes. If a person does not seek immediate treatment for DKA, it can lead to kidney failure, cardiac arrest, or even death.  It is vital that people with diabetes, as well as their loved ones, are aware of the warning signs.  The more quickly a person seeks treatment for DKA, the better their chance of making a complete recovery.
