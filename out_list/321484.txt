 The two main types of  cholesterol  are high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or "good" cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or "bad" cholesterol. Some cholesterol is needed in the body, but high levels can be dangerous.  In this article, we look at HDL and LDL in detail, including what makes one good and the other bad, as well as what a person can do to keep levels in check.  LDL cholesterol is often called bad cholesterol. If there is too much LDL cholesterol in the blood, it builds up in the walls of the blood vessels, causing them to narrow and stiffen.  A buildup of LDL cholesterol reduces blood flow and can increase the risk of  heart attack  or  stroke .  HDL or good cholesterol can move LDL cholesterol from the blood to the liver, which breaks it down for disposal as waste. HDL cholesterol is referred to as good cholesterol because it reduces the level of cholesterol in the blood.  Higher HDL levels are linked to a reduced risk of heart attack and  heart disease .  In the United States, cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The  guidelines  for healthy cholesterol levels are as follows:  Different regions and countries may have varying guidelines, so it is wise to speak to a doctor about the most accurate and up-to-date ranges.  The total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio can help a person know if they are consuming enough good cholesterol and to limit sources of bad cholesterol. It can be measured by dividing the total cholesterol by the HDL level.  Ideally, the ratio should be below 4. The lower this number is, the healthier a person's cholesterol levels are.  Total cholesterol does fluctuate, so more than one blood test might be required for an accurate assessment. Levels can change following a meal, so sometimes a blood test will be taken first thing in the morning before a person has breakfast.   Studies  suggest that the total cholesterol to HDL ratio is a better marker of the risk of heart disease than LDL cholesterol levels alone.   Non-HDL cholesterol   Another method of assessing cholesterol levels is calculating a non-HDL cholesterol level. This is measured by subtracting HDL cholesterol from the total cholesterol.  This method is considered to be more accurate by some doctors because it includes very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels in the calculation.  Similarly to LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol can also build up inside the walls of blood vessels, which is undesirable.  Ideally, a non-HDL cholesterol level should be  less than 130 mg/dL . A higher value than that increases the risk for heart disease.  Causes of high LDL cholesterol include:  The following lifestyle changes can help lower LDL cholesterol:   Some studies  have shown vitamin B-3 can lower LDL cholesterol while raising HDL. It is important to talk to a doctor before taking niacin supplements.  People trying to lower their LDL cholesterol should also avoid eating saturated and trans fats. Foods to avoid are:  Other diet tips to prevent LDL levels creeping up include:  A variety of things can improve HDL cholesterol levels, including:  High LDL cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease, but it can often occur without any symptoms.  It is recommended that people over 40 years of age arrange a blood test to check their cholesterol levels and total cholesterol to HDL ratio.  Dietary and lifestyle changes can make a big difference to HDL and LDL levels. If they do not improve with these changes, a doctor may recommend medications.
