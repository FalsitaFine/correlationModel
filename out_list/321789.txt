  Arthritis  is a term used to describe  over 100  conditions that cause joint pain or joint damage. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting over  30 million  Americans.  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and OA share some common symptoms, but there are also some key differences between the conditions.  Symptoms of each include:  People with PsA may have:  Symptoms of PsA typically affect the:  Below is a 3-D model of psoriatic arthritis.  This model is fully interactive and can be explored with your mouse pad or touchscreen.  Symptoms of OA vary and depend on the part of the body that is affected. OA symptoms generally include:  OA can affect any joint but most commonly occurs in the:  The following key symptoms can help differentiate between PsA and OA:  The causes of each are quite different:  PsA is an inflammatory autoimmune condition. This means that inflammation and other symptoms stem from a problem with the immune system.  Scientists do not yet know why this happens, however.  Genetic and environmental factors also play a role in this disease process.  PsA often affects those with the skin condition psoriasis. Around  30%  of people with psoriasis will develop PsA. Skin symptoms usually develop before joint symptoms. Arthritis symptoms appear first in  15%  of cases.  OA, on the other hand, is caused by the gradual breakdown of cartilage at the end of the bones. Cartilage is a flexible, slippery tissue that cushions and protects the ends of bones, allowing them to move against one another without friction.  If the cartilage completely wears away, the action of bone against bone results in pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. It also causes irreversible damage to both the joint and bones.  Factors that increase the risk of getting PsA include:  Risk factors for OA include:  There is no cure for either PsA or OA, but treatment can relieve symptoms and help prevent further damage.  Treatments for PsA include:   Medications   The  first-line treatment  for most people with a new diagnosis of PsA is biologic therapy. These drugs target a specific part of the immune system to treat the underlying cause of PsA.  However, not everyone can use these drugs, as they can have adverse effects.  Alternatives include oral small-molecule drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, both of which are systemic treatments that work throughout the body to reduce inflammation or suppress the immune system.  Treatments for symptoms and flares include:   Surgery   A surgeon may replace a joint with an artificial joint that is made from plastic and metal if it is severely damaged.   Lifestyle changes   Some lifestyle modifications that may help include:  OA symptoms can be managed through:   Medication   Pain can be alleviated with:   Therapies   A doctor may recommend  physical therapy  and occupational therapy for people with OA.  A physical therapist can create an exercise program to reduce pain, strengthen the muscles, and increase the range of motion.  An occupational therapist teaches people how to reduce the pressure on their joints when carrying out everyday tasks.   Surgery   Surgery may be necessary to replace severely damaged joints. A replacement joint is the last resort option.   Lifestyle changes   Lifestyle changes that may help OA include:  There is no cure for either PsA or OA, but symptoms can be managed with  Joints that are severely damaged may require surgery.  People with painful, swollen, or stiff joints should see a doctor if symptoms persist for a few weeks. These conditions can be disabling and cause further joint damage without treatment.
