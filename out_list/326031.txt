 This article outlines the use of  chemotherapy drugs  in the treatment of different  cancers . We describe how many people with different types of cancer undergo  chemotherapy  as part of their treatment.  We also give information about survival rates for people with these types of cancer, according to the stage of cancer when a person received the diagnosis.  There are a variety of factors that may affect how successful chemotherapy is and a person's survival rate. These factors include:   Cancer survival rates  are one way to show how effective various treatments, including chemotherapy, can be.  A survival rate refers to the percentage of people who live for a certain amount of time after a cancer diagnosis.  Survival rates can also help people gain an understanding of their outlook because they provide information about the likely outcomes of people with similar cancers.  However, it is essential to remember that a range of factors influences survival rates and chemotherapy success rates. Many of these factors vary from person to person.  Cancer  grade  is a measure of how abnormal the cancer cells appear under a microscope. More abnormal cells tend to grow and spread at a faster rate.  Cancer stage indicates how large a  tumor  is and how far its cells have spread. A doctor can use various systems to determine what stage a cancer has reached.  They may use the following  0–5 scaling system :  Researchers who collect data to determine cancer statistics may use the following  terms  to describe the cancer stage:  Other factors that can affect the success of chemotherapy include:   In this article, we describe the next steps when chemotherapy is not effective .  People usually receive chemotherapy, or chemo, alongside other treatments, such as surgery and  radiotherapy . This can make it difficult for researchers to determine which therapy has what effect.  As such, it is not possible to provide success rates for chemotherapy alone. The following examples show overall survival rates for people with different types of cancer, along with the percentage of those receiving chemotherapy as part of their treatment.  The statistics below are from the  American Cancer Society's 2016–2017 report  on cancer treatment and survivorship. The figures all refer to people in the United States.  This report uses 5-year relative survival rates, which describe the percentage of people who live for at least 5 years after their cancer diagnosis.   Most people  with stage 1, 2, or 3  breast cancer  undergo surgery as part of their treatment.  Some people may have a  mastectomy , in which a surgeon removes the breast. Others may have breast conserving surgery (BCS), which involves removing the tumor and some of the surrounding healthy tissue.  Some people receive chemo with or instead of surgery.  The table below shows the percentages of females with breast cancer who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy, according to  recent estimates .    Learn more about the stages of breast cancer here .   Breast cancer survival   The following table shows survival rates among females with breast cancer, depending on the stage at diagnosis.  This refers to cancer of the colon or rectum.  Surgical options for  colorectal cancer  include:   Colon cancer   The table below shows the  percentages  of people with  colon cancer  who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy.   Rectal cancer   The table below shows the percentages of people with rectal cancer who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy.   Colorectal cancer survival   The following table gives  information  about survival rates for people with colorectal cancer, according to its stage at diagnosis.   Find out more about colorectal cancer here .  Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  is a type of cancer that begins in cells called lymphocytes. These are immune system cells that help the body fight infection.  Around 69% of people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receive chemo. Among them, 58% receive chemo alone, while 11% receive a combination of chemo and radiotherapy.   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma survival   The following table gives  information  about survival rates for people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to its stage at diagnosis.   Learn more about lymphoma here .  There are  two types  of lung cancer: small-cell and non-small cell (N-SC).  Around  13%  of  lung cancers  are small-cell. Most people with this type receive chemotherapy.  Approximately 83% of lung cancers are N-SC. The remaining 3% are undefined.  The table below gives  information  about the types of treatment that people with N-SC lung cancer receive.   Lung cancer survival   The following table shows survival rates for people with N-SC lung cancer, according to the stage at diagnosis.   Find out more about lung cancer here .   Testicular cancer  is cancer in one or both testicles. Around 97% of testicular cancers begin in the germ cells. These are cells that develop into sperm.  Tumors that develop from germ cells are called testicular germ cell tumors. There are two types: seminomatous tumors, which tend to be slow-growing, and non-seminomatous tumors, which usually grow more rapidly.   Seminomatous tumors   The table below shows the  percentages  of males who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy for early or late stage seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors.   Nonseminomatous tumors   The table below shows the percentages of males who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy for early or late stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors.  We also show the percentage of those who undergo a procedure called  retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) .   Testicular cancer survival   The following table shows information about survival rates for males with testicular cancer, according to its stage at diagnosis. These figures combine data from people with either type of tumor.   Learn more about testicular cancer here .  Most people with bladder cancer receive one of the following  surgeries :   Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor,  a minimally invasive procedure that involves removing the bladder tumor via the urethra.   Cystectomy,  which involves removing part or all of the bladder, as well as the surrounding fatty tissue and lymph nodes.  About  52%  of people with bladder cancer receive some form of chemotherapy treatment. Among them:   Bladder cancer survival   The 5-year relative survival rate for localized bladder cancer varies by the type of cancer. Around  25%  of bladder cancers invade the muscle wall of the bladder.  The 5-year relative survival rate is 47% for localized, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and 81% for localized bladder cancer that is not muscle-invasive.  The following table shows  more information  about survival rates for people with bladder cancer, according to the stage at diagnosis. Figures for invasive and noninvasive cancers are combined.

The table below shows the percentages of women who undergo treatment involving chemotherapy for uterine corpus cancer by stage.   Uterine corpus cancer survival   The following table shows  information  about survival rates among people with uterine corpus cancer, according to its stage at diagnosis.   Uterine cancer is also called endometrial cancer. Learn more here .  Usually, people receive chemotherapy alongside other treatments. This makes it difficult to determine a person's survival rate and success with chemotherapy alone.  Many other factors affect treatment success, including the type and stage of cancer, as well as personal characteristics, such as age and overall health.  Survival rates provide an estimate based on the outcomes of people with similar cancer diagnoses.  A doctor, especially an oncologist, can take all the relevant factors into account and give a better idea about a person's outlook.
