 In this article, we take a close look at brain stem  strokes , including the symptoms, diagnosis, recovery, and outlook.  According to the  World Health Organization (WHO) , stroke is the "second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability" worldwide.  A stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted, either due to a blocked artery or a leaking blood vessel.  The brain stem is located at the base of the brain and is responsible for receiving and relaying information throughout the body.  The brain stem controls essential body functions, such as:  Brain stem strokes can affect a person's fundamental bodily functions and may lead to long-term complications.  There are two main types of strokes, both of which can affect the brain stem:   Ischemic stroke   Ischemic strokes occur when blood clots form in the narrow arteries in the head or neck, cutting off the blood supply to an area of the brain.  Ischemic strokes are the most common type, accounting for  87 percent  of all strokes. Around  10 percent  of all ischemic strokes affect the brain stem.  A  transient ischemic attack  (TIA), also called a  mini-stroke  or a warning stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. TIAs cause milder symptoms than full ischemic strokes, and most symptoms go away within an hour.   Hemorrhagic stroke   Hemorrhagic strokes, or brain bleeds occur when a weak blood vessel leaks or breaks open, creating swelling and pressure. This pressure damages tissues and cells in the brain.  Hemorrhagic strokes are less common than other types of stroke, but they account for  40 percent  of all stroke deaths.  Because the brain stem controls a variety of motor functions, strokes in this area of the brain cause a diverse range of symptoms.  Brain stem strokes can disrupt vital bodily functions, such as:  The brain stem receives various signals from the brain and sends them to different parts of the body. Brain stem strokes disrupt these signals, which is why people experience  physical symptoms , including numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs.  Other common stroke symptoms include:  If a person experiences symptoms of a stroke, their doctor will use imaging tests, such as CT and  MRI scans  to determine whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic.  Doctors may also order additional procedures, such as blood tests, echocardiograms, carotid  ultrasounds , and cerebral angiography.  Because the brain stem is responsible for several vital bodily functions, a stroke in this area of the brain can have devastating effects on necessary motor-skills and processes, such as eye movement, speech, and spatial reasoning.  A rare, but severe type of brain stem stroke can result in a person developing  locked-in syndrome , which causes full-body paralysis—except for the muscles that control eye movement.  A brain stem stroke is a medical emergency. It requires immediate treatment to save lives and reduce the risk of lasting complications.  Treatment depends on the type, location, and severity of stroke:  Treatment for an ischemic stroke involves restoring blood flow by eliminating the clot. Methods include the following:  Treatment for hemorrhagic strokes focuses on controlling bleeding and reducing pressure in the brain. Treatment methods include:  Once bleeding in the brain is under control, doctors may perform surgical procedures to repair the broken blood vessel to prevent it from hemorrhaging again.  Anyone can have a stroke, but specific  genetic factors , such as family history, gender, race, and age put some people at higher risk for stroke than others.  According to the American Stroke Association, women have more strokes than men and are more likely to die from a stroke than men.  Some risk factors that are unique to women include:  People of African-American and Hispanic descent are also at higher risk of stroke.  The majority of strokes occur in people over the age of 65. However,  research  suggests that the rate of stroke hospitalizations and the presence of stroke risk factors in younger adults has increased significantly.  Medical conditions that increase the risk of stroke include:  People cannot control genetic factors, but they can control lifestyle factors that increase the risk of stroke. Behaviors that increase high blood pressure or the risk of clot formation can lead to a higher risk of stroke.  Behaviors that can increase the risk of stroke include:  An estimated  80 percent  of strokes are preventable. People can reduce their risk of stroke by making the following lifestyle changes:  A brain stem stroke can result in severe long-term complications. Medication and behavioral changes can help reduce the risk of future strokes.   Physical therapy  can improve muscle strength, coordination, and ultimately help people regain lost motor skills.  Occupational and speech and language therapy can help people improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory, problem-solving, and judgment.  Some people who have had a brain stem stroke and have severe disabilities may require psychological counseling to help them adjust.
