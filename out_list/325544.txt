 The cervix is a circular band of muscle that separates the uterus from the vagina. The cervix changes at different points in the menstrual cycle and throughout the stages of pregnancy.  In this article, we look at how the cervix and cervical discharge change in the early stages of pregnancy. We also discuss how women can check their cervix for changes.  The cervix undergoes various changes throughout the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy, which we discuss in the following sections.  When a woman is not pregnant, the position of her cervix changes throughout the stages of the menstrual cycle:  If a woman has conceived, the cervix will remain higher in the vagina, with its position being similar to that during ovulation.  The texture of the cervix also changes in early pregnancy due to increased blood flow. If the woman has not conceived, the cervix will feel firm to the touch, like the tip of a nose. If she has conceived, the cervix will feel softer, more closely resembling the lips.  The consistency and color of cervical discharge change in different stages of the menstrual cycle. Some women use the consistency of their discharge, or cervical fluid, to track the stages of their menstrual cycle. This technique is one component of natural family planning.  Understanding the typical cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle can help women identify early pregnancy:  A woman who has conceived during her cycle may notice cervical mucus increasing instead of drying up after ovulation.  According to the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , light bleeding or spotting may occur around the time of implantation, which is generally 1â€“2 weeks after conception.  Feeling the cervix offers clues regarding early pregnancy, but it is not a sure way to detect pregnancy. Cervical changes may be subtle, and not all women will be familiar enough with their cervix to pick up on the changes. The only guaranteed way to check for pregnancy is with a pregnancy test.  However, women can check their cervix at home. To do this, they should clean the hands thoroughly before placing a finger into the vagina. The location of the cervix is in the top wall, nearest the stomach, and it should feel like a small bump.  Women who are trying to conceive may wish to become familiar with their cervical patterns. Doing this will make them better able to pick up on changes that occur during ovulation and early pregnancy.  Cervical changes are among the many changes that the body undergoes during early pregnancy. Other symptoms of early pregnancy include:  These symptoms are not unique to a pregnancy and may be reasonably mild initially. The same symptoms can also appear just before a menstrual period. It is not possible to tell whether a woman is pregnant without her taking a pregnancy test.  Women who think that they might be pregnant should make an appointment with a doctor. They should also talk to a doctor if they miss their period for several months and are not pregnant or if they experience vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.  During early pregnancy, it is best to talk to a doctor if cervical discharge is:  Additionally, a person should let their doctor know if they are experiencing vaginal itching or pain. These symptoms can indicate other infections that may affect the cervix.  Women can expect their cervix to change throughout pregnancy. During early pregnancy, the cervix will change slightly in position and in how it feels to the touch. Cervical discharge will also change in consistency and color.  During pregnancy, a woman should see her doctor if she has any doubts, questions, or concerns.
