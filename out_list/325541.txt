 Castor oil is a vegetable oil that comes from the seeds of the castor oil plant. There are different types of castor oil, depending on the processing method.  One study from  2003  showed that castor oil increased the "luster" of hair, which might suggest that the same is true for eyelashes.  In the sections below, we discuss the types of castor oil and whether they work to improve the appearance of the eyelashes. We also cover how to use it and consider the risks associated with castor oil use.  Jamaican black castor oil is darker due to the manufacturers roasting the castor seeds first, before extracting the oil. In contrast, cold-pressed castor oil does not use heat in the process and is pale yellow with a mild odor.  Although there has been no scientific research into which specific castor oil is best to use for eyelash treatment, anecdotal usage on the eyelashes has included both types.  There is also hydrogenated castor oil, which manufacturers process with hydrogen to make it solid at room temperature. Hydrogenated castor oil is in many cosmetic items.  High quality, pure castor oil may be best to use on the body. These types may have better safety and effectiveness.  All types of castor oil contain similar properties, which may help improve the appearance of the eyelashes.  Castor oil contains  90%  ricinoleic acid, according to a study in the  International Journal of Science and Research .  Ricinoleic acid contains high levels of triglycerides, which  may help moisturize  eyelashes. Also, the oil contains omega-6 fatty acids, which may help improve the health of hair.  One  2015 study  found that ricinoleic acid was a potential prostaglandin D2 inhibitor, which means that it may be useful in preventing  hair loss .  Other  research  has found higher levels of prostaglandin D2 in balding scalps compared with those with more hair. In 17 men with male pattern  baldness , there were higher levels of prostaglandin D2 in the bald scalps than in the scalps with hair.  The  International Journal of Science and Research  study also suggests that applying castor oil to the eyelashes can increase blood circulation to the hair root and encourage new growth.  There are no scientific guidelines for using castor oil on the eyelashes. However, anecdotal research suggests trying the following methods:  If a person experiences an allergic reaction, such as a rash or itchiness, they should wash off the castor oil and stop using it. If symptoms persist, it may be a good idea to see a doctor.  Castor oil is present in many cosmetic products, including lipsticks and skin care products. Scientists have found castor oil to have  low toxicity , and other research has found  100% concentration  of hydrogenated castor oil safe for use in cosmetics.  That said, it may trigger an  allergic reaction , such as skin irritation, in some people.  People should test castor oil on an area of skin away from their eyes and face before using it on their eyelashes. If people experience any irritation from the castor oil, they should wash it off and stop using it.  People should try to avoid getting castor oil in their eyes. The  American Academy of Ophthalmology  recommend using sterile products for the eyes, and people should always follow the advice of their doctor or ophthalmologist when using products on or near the eyes.  People should also take care when ingesting castor oil, as it is a  laxative  and can cause  diarrhea .  Pregnant women should also avoid taking castor oil, as it can  induce labor .  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have  approved  Latisse for enhancing eyelash growth. Latisse is a prescription medicine that increases the length, thickness, and darkness of eyelashes.  Latisse contains a solution of bimatoprost, which is generally safe when people apply it to the base of their eyelashes.  However, some reported side effects of Latisse include:  These side effects should pass when people stop using Latisse. However, one potentially permanent side effect of the medication is a darkening of the iris.  According to the  American Academy of Ophthalmology , people with existing eye conditions — such as  conjunctivitis , macular  edema , or  uveitis  — should not use Latisse.  People who wish to use Latisse should check with their doctor or ophthalmologist to ensure that it is safe for them to use.  There is no scientific research to support the theory that castor oil will make eyelashes grow longer or thicker. However, it may help increase the luster of eyelashes, making them appear thicker and glossier.  People should try to avoid getting castor oil in their eyes, and they should stop using it if it causes any irritation.  People with an existing eye condition should speak to their doctor before using castor oil on their eyelashes. There are alternatives, such as Latisse, available.
