 People with mild low blood sugar, which doctors call  insulin  reaction or  hypoglycemia , are usually conscious and can treat themselves. People experiencing hypoglycemia often experience  headaches , dizziness, sweating, shaking, and a feeling of  anxiety .  When a person experiences diabetic shock, or severe hypoglycemia, they may lose consciousness, have trouble speaking, and experience  double vision . Early treatment is essential because blood sugar levels that stay low for too long can lead to seizures or  diabetic coma .  Hypoglycemia can sometimes happen rapidly and may even occur when a person follows their  diabetes  treatment plan.  Knowing the symptoms, potential complications, and possible treatment options can be vital for a person living with diabetes. Read on to learn more.  A person's blood sugar levels naturally rise and fall throughout the day. Typically, they rise shortly after a meal and dip after physical activity or fasting. Most people do not feel any negative effects from these changes, but they can cause problems for people with diabetes.  Early signs of low blood sugar levels include:  Symptoms of hypoglycemia often get worse and can even be fatal if left untreated. Symptoms of diabetic shock, or severe hypoglycemia may include:  Hypoglycemia can also disrupt a person's sleep due to:  If a person suspects they have hypoglycemia, they should get treatment as soon as possible. Hypoglycemia affects a person's movement and ability to think clearly, which can cause serious accidents, especially if it happens while someone is driving or working.  Some people may not experience the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia. Doctors call this hypoglycemia unawareness, and it is more common when a person has had diabetes for a long time or if the person has experienced frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.  Lack of the initial warning signs, such as shaking and sweating, may cause the episode to progress fast to seizure and loss of consciousness. If a person's hypoglycemia awareness is impaired, it is imperative that they monitor their blood sugar levels very closely.  Taking  insulin  is the most common cause of hypoglycemia and its most severe form, diabetic shock. However, some oral diabetes medication, especially those in the sulfonylurea class of drugs, which act by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin, can also lead to low blood sugar. Examples of such drugs include Amaryl, Glyburide, and Glipizide.  Other risk factors for hypoglycemia include:  If a person with  type 1 diabetes  or  type 2 diabetes  starts to notice symptoms of low blood sugar, they can take some steps to help raise their blood glucose levels to a normal range.  According to the  American Diabetes Association (ADA) , a person should check blood glucose levels first. If the levels are low, consume a sugary snack or drink containing 15 grams (g) of  carbohydrate , then recheck blood sugar levels after about 15 minutes.  If the levels are still low, repeat the process and consume another sugary food or drink. Once the levels have returned to normal, a person can return to their regular meal and snack schedule.  Doctors may prescribe a hormone called glucagon to people who are at risk of diabetic shock. Glucagon comes in a syringe, and a person can use it in an emergency to help their blood glucose levels return to normal.  If a person experiencing hypoglycemia becomes unconscious, turn them on their side and deliver a glucagon shot. According to the ADA, the person should come round within 15 minutes. If they do not, they will need immediate medical attention, so call 911.  A person should take warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia extremely seriously. When blood glucose levels are too low, it can affect brain functioning and lead to complications, such as:  When treating hypoglycemia, it is vital that a person does not take more glucose than they need, as this can cause blood sugar levels to rebound too high.  There are some general lifestyle changes a person can make to help avoid diabetic shock and hypoglycemia, including:  Also, people can adjust their blood sugar targets according to their individual needs. For example, people with hypoglycemia unawareness might benefit from targeting a higher blood sugar.  People can prevent complications by carrying a medical alert bracelet or another form of identification to inform emergency personnel that they have diabetes.  Very low blood sugar levels or diabetic shock can lead to life-threatening complications, such as diabetic  coma , if left untreated.  People who take insulin are most at risk of diabetic shock. However, anyone taking diabetes medication is susceptible.  A person can help avoid diabetic shock by carefully monitoring their blood glucose levels, following their treatment plan, and by eating regular meals. If a person goes into diabetic shock, those with them should administer glucagon if there is any available and call 911.
