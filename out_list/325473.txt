 Although there is no cure for  multiple sclerosis  (MS), some treatments — including steroids — can help slow the progression of the condition and reduce symptom severity during flares.  Read on to learn more about steroids for MS.  A doctor may prescribe intravenous or oral steroids when a person with MS experiences a flare. However, although steroids can be effective for reducing the severity and duration of a person's symptoms during the flare, they can cause unpleasant side effects.  For this reason, a doctor may only recommend steroids when a person has a severe flare that interferes with their ability to function.  Doctors may be more likely to prescribe a round of steroids for a person with an MS flare if they are experiencing any of the following symptoms:  The steroids that doctors use to treat MS flares are glucocorticoids. These reduce  inflammation , which is a trigger for MS symptoms.  Doctors often use glucocorticoids to treat other health conditions in which inflammation plays a role, such as  asthma  and severe allergy attacks.  For treating MS flares, a doctor will often suggest intravenous methylprednisolone once per day for 3–5 days. Sometimes, they choose to follow the intravenous steroid treatment with steroid pills, which the person will take in a tapering dosage for an additional 1–2 weeks.  In the past, many doctors presumed that intravenous forms of steroids were the best. However, a recent  study  showed that high dosages of oral steroids are just as effective.  Doctors typically use steroids to help a person experiencing a symptom flare. Steroid treatment will help a person with MS recover from the acute symptoms of the flare.  However, steroids do not have a lasting or profound impact on the overall treatment of MS. So, healthcare providers do not consider steroids a primary form of treatment for MS.  Often, the symptoms that a person experiences during a flare will gradually get better on their own. Not everyone who has a flare will require steroids to recover. A person should speak to their healthcare provider to determine whether steroids are a suitable treatment option for them.  It is important to note that people with an active infection should not take steroids. Infections, such as colds or  urinary tract infections , can make MS symptoms worse.  Steroids can also make an infection worse, so people should let their doctor know if they are sick before taking steroids.  After treating the infection, MS symptoms may also start to fade.  Steroids for MS are available in the form of injections and oral medications.  Although the actual dosages that people take may vary, one  study  defined high-dose methylprednisolone as higher than 500 milligrams (mg) per day and low-dose as lower than 48 mg per day. It concluded that high dosages, around 500–1,000 mg per day, taken intravenously for 3–5 days are the most effective.  The injectable form of steroids typically comes as a powder that healthcare professionals mix with a liquid. They will administer the injection directly into either a vein or muscle.  The oral form of steroids often comes as a tablet, which a person will need to swallow whole. A person should also take the medication with food to help prevent an  upset stomach .  Tablets are much easier for people to take than regularly coming in for appointments to receive an injection.  A person should follow their healthcare provider's instructions for how long to take steroids for and the dosage they should take. If someone accidentally skips a dose, they should take it as soon as they remember and let their doctor know.  Steroid injections are reportedly quite effective in high dosages. However, they tend to be more expensive and an unpleasant way to receive medication.  One  recent study  determined that high-dose oral steroids can be just as effective as injections. Also, they are usually less expensive and offer a more comfortable way to take medication.  Both oral and injectable steroids come with some risks.  Oral steroids may cause the following side effects:  When taking an oral steroid for MS, a person should call their healthcare provider immediately if they experience any of the following symptoms:  Injectable steroids also carry a degree of risk. Some side effects to be aware of include:  If a person taking injectable steroids notices any of the following symptoms, they should call their healthcare provider immediately:  Some other considerations for people receiving steroid injections include:  If people use steroids long-term, they should not stop them suddenly. A doctor and patient can develop a plan to safely taper off the steroids.  For acute MS flares, steroids are usually an effective treatment option. Typically, people should not take them long-term.  Steroids come in two forms: oral and injectable. Both can be effective in high enough dosages to treat an MS flare.  A person should be aware of potential side effects and call their doctor if they experience any severe symptoms.
